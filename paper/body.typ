= About this document
<about-this-document>
This is the #emph[BDL Design and Formalization Monograph]: a living
technical record of the Behavior Design Language. It is the
authoritative narrative design record of BDL --- the one document that
says, for every construct, why it is there, what was tried instead,
which theorem or counterexample decided it, how production implements
it, where production differs from the model, and what remains open. It
is a bridge between the formal model (`KCN-judu/BDL_FV`, Lean 4) and the
production system (`KCN-judu/BDL`, Rust and Flutter); a record of
successful #emph[and] rejected design alternatives; an evidence ledger;
and a reference for future implementation and research.

It is #strong[not] a conference submission, a page-limited paper, a
polished retrospective in which the design emerged fully formed, or a
marketing document. It is not written to a page count; completeness,
provenance, negative results, design evolution and correspondence to
production matter more than compactness. Where an earlier draft of BDL
took a position that later evidence broke, the record keeps both and
says what broke it. The directory the document lives in is still called
`paper/` because renaming it would break history; reader-facing text
says #emph[monograph] or #emph[record].

== Purpose, current result, scope
<purpose-current-result-scope>
#strong[Purpose.] Industrial products increasingly combine physical form
with sensing, computation and control, and their designers have no
medium for behavior with the immediacy that CAD has for geometry. BDL
asks whether product behavior can be a #emph[design material]: a
language whose primary object is the typed product relationship ---
`Tilt → Brightness` --- which may be declared before it is defined,
checked while incomplete, simulated, and eventually realized on
hardware, with the implementation machinery elaborated underneath rather
than authored.

#strong[Current result.] A small kernel, derived by a mechanized
design-space exploration in Lean 4 and stated in Parts III--IX: an
environment of named declarations with frozen types, monotone public
commitments and write-once realizations; nominal concepts constructed
only where a signature announces them; dimensions in the types of
primitive operators; one temporal primitive that reads a clock domain at
its previous activation; nominal clock domains and nominal logical
outputs with one explicit driver each. Above it, proved constructions
rather than kernel constructs: list and product data with one recursor,
a definitional equation library with rank-1 instantiation by matching,
units as coordinates with exact affine charts, natural binder syntax as
conservative desugaring, behavior components and groups that flatten
into the same kernel, the canonical interface type `() -> B` whose
kernel value is `B`, and the provision of a Source at deployment by a
raw reading and a pure transducer, proved transparent to the design. A
separate validation layer decides hardware feasibility and collection
capacity. Production implements the language as a Rust toolchain ---
model, elaborator, checker, reference evaluator, `no_std` code
generator, daemon, IDE service --- and a Flutter authoring environment,
Studio, whose every semantic verdict is a projection from the compiler.

#strong[Formal scope.] Thirteen phases, 55 Lean modules, no `sorry`,
propositional extensionality and quotient soundness as the only axioms,
no classical choice. Every theorem is about the #emph[model]\; none is
about the Rust or Dart code.

#strong[Production scope.] Production is described #strong[as of commit
`de8154f5153495de2ad8a09f3ca3166c3678dc93` of `KCN-judu/BDL`,
2026-09-20] (after the syntax-highlighting milestone; protocol 0.21).
The formal development is described as of the working tree that contains
this revision of the document, whose last pushed commit is `af25567`
(Phase 13); Phase 14 (output realization) is in the same working tree.
Every sentence about production is a sentence about that commit;
volatile details are gathered in the production snapshot (Part XIII and
Appendix F) so that the conceptual chapters do not go stale with the
next milestone. Where a statement was only checked at an earlier
snapshot, the text says so.

#strong[How to use this document.] Read Parts I--II for the problem and
the language as a designer meets it. Parts III--X are the formal
development organized by concept, not by the order in which it was done:
the declaration model, semantic identity and quantities, the equation
language, units, reactive semantics, behavior systems, the environment
and physical boundaries, validation and deployment. Parts XI--XII
describe production: the compiler, runtime and daemon, then Studio and
the IDE. Part XIII is the formal ↔ production correspondence, construct
by construct, with every deviation and its reason. Part XIV is
minimality and the rejected alternatives. Part XV is the open agenda,
with the empirical questions kept apart from the formal ones. The
related-work chapter places BDL against the traditions it borrows from.
The appendices are the reference apparatus: notation, the theorem index
by concept, the decision index, the evidence-strength ledger, the
migration map from the old decision numbers, the production snapshot,
the development chronology and the revision log. Phase numbers (Phase 0
… Phase 13) appear throughout as #emph[provenance] --- the order in
which hypotheses were tested --- never as the structure of the
exposition.

== Claim strength
<claim-strength>
Every substantive claim carries one of the following labels, used in the
text, in the ledgers of the appendices, and --- with production's own
words --- in production's records
(`docs/project/formal-correspondence.md` there, and the `fv` field of
each ADR). The labels are never flattened into "BDL guarantees".

  )

"Minimal" is never claimed globally. Where the formal development says
minimal it means #emph[minimal among the tested candidates], or
#emph[the smallest design found that supports the required cases], and
the text says which.

== Identifiers
<identifiers>
Formal design decisions are `FVD-NNNN` and formal open items `FVI-NNNN`
(`docs/decisions/`, `docs/issues/` in the formal repository);
production's records are `ADR-NNNN`, `PRP-NNNN` and `ISS-NNNN`
(`docs/decisions/`, `docs/proposals/`, `docs/issues/` in the production
repository). Where a formal decision and a production record concern the
same architectural question the text cites the two together ---
`ADR-0032 (FVD-0118)` --- and no competing number is minted for a fact
production already names. Until 2026-09-20 the formal decisions were
numbered `D-01 … D-130` in a single ledger; Appendix E is the permanent
map, and archived documents keep the old numbers. Theorem names are
semantic identity and never change to track a document id:
`provision_transparent` is that theorem whether its record is cited as
`PRP-0001`, `FVD-0126` or a section of this document.

= Part I --- Purpose and Design Position
<part-i-purpose-and-design-position>
== Introduction
<introduction>
Industrial design is increasingly concerned with products whose behavior
is determined not only by geometry, materials, and mechanisms, but also
by sensing, logic, timing, software, and networked control. A cup may
infer that it has been lifted, a lamp may adapt to ambient conditions, a
medical device may gate an action on multiple safety conditions, and a
consumer robot may continuously map sensor estimates to actuator
behavior. In such products, behavior is no longer a late implementation
detail. It is part of the product concept.

Yet the dominant design media remain asymmetrical. Industrial designers
have mature media for shape, layout, appearance, and physical assembly,
while product behavior is usually externalized through prose,
storyboards, flowcharts, state diagrams, interactive mock-ups, or ad hoc
embedded code. The first four are easy to sketch but weak as executable
specifications; the last is executable but forces the designer to adopt
implementation-oriented concepts such as mutable variables, callbacks,
polling loops, and device APIs. Existing physical prototyping systems
such as Phidgets and d.tools substantially lowered the cost of building
interactive prototypes @greenberg2001phidgets@hartmann2006dtools, but
their behavioral representations still inherit important assumptions
from programming and state-machine formalisms.

A concrete instance of the resulting cost appeared in a two-day
introductory hardware workshop that the author designed and taught for
ten participants with no prior embedded experience. Two of the available
sensors behaved in opposite ways: the ambient-light sensor reports
larger values as illumination increases, while the distance sensor
reports smaller values as the target recedes. Participants lost track of
which was which, repeatedly and across the whole group. This pattern
suggests a representational problem rather than merely a syntactic one.
Whether a reading rises or falls with the quantity it measures is a
stable fact about a device, and in the code they were writing there was
nowhere to record it. It survived only as a sign buried inside an
expression and had to be reconstructed each time it was needed. The
obstacle was not syntax. A piece of semantic information had no place to
live.

BDL draws a different boundary. The goal is not to make engineering
representations merely easier for designers to use. The goal is to
define a #emph[native representation of product behavior for design
itself], while retaining enough formal structure for static checking,
simulation, and eventual implementation.

The system is #strong[BDL], a Behavior Design Language. BDL is organized
around a working hypothesis: when a behavioral relationship is first
specified, #emph[what kind of relationship should exist] is frequently
settled before its exact implementation is. A designer may know that
#strong[Tilt influences Brightness] before deciding the transfer
function; that #strong[CupPickedUp] should activate a behavior before
deciding which sensor and threshold detect pickup; or that a safety
condition should suppress an actuator before choosing the device driver.
Therefore the primary design artifact should be the #emph[typed
relationship], not the procedure that computes it.

The central example is a relationship. Instead of decomposing a design
into procedural steps such as “read tilt,” “calculate brightness,” and
“set the LED,” BDL represents one mapping:

$ ? f : upright("Tilt") arrow.r upright("Brightness") . $

The mapping may exist before its body. A formula, curve, examples, or a
fitted function can later be attached as a definition of the same block.
Once a formula is supplied, for example

$ f\(theta\)= "clamp" (0.2 + 0.8 theta / 60^compose \, 0 \, 1)\, $

it inhabits the previously declared signature. The claim attached to
this #strong[signature-first] model is deliberately narrow. It is not
that designers universally think in signatures before bodies, nor that
they should be trained to. It is that an unresolved typed relationship
is a legal, statically meaningful state of the design, so that stopping
between declaring a relationship and realizing it costs nothing. Whether
designers make use of that position, and at what level of task
complexity, is an empirical question that remains open; Part XV states
it as such and lists the studies that would answer it.

<fig:mapping>

BDL separates a designer-facing surface language from a small formal
kernel. The kernel presented here was not designed on paper and then
implemented. It was derived by a mechanized design-space exploration in
the Lean 4 proof assistant @moura2021lean: each candidate construct from
an earlier draft of the language was formalized, attacked with
counterexamples, reduced to other constructs where possible, and kept
only when the tested alternatives failed for a stated reason. The result
is smaller than the draft it replaced. Clock-indexed signal types, a
separate event type, effect rows, action requests, and runtime actuator
arbitration were all removed, each for a reason recorded in the
accompanying development. What remains is an environment of named
declarations with frozen expected types, monotone public commitments,
and write-once realizations; nominal semantic types whose values can be
constructed only inside a declaration whose own signature announces the
concept; physical dimensions carried in the types of primitive
operators; one temporal primitive that reads a clock domain at its
previous activation; nominal clock domains with a separate domain
judgment; and nominal physical outputs with a single explicit driver
each. A validation layer outside the kernel decides whether a design can
be placed on a declared target board. Later phases added, each for a
reason recorded in Parts IV--VII, list and product data with one
recursor, behavior components and groups, an exact model of units and
charts, and an interface-level account of the canonical type `() -> B`
that leaves the kernel without a unit; nothing that was removed has
returned.

The interaction model of Part II and the formal architecture of Parts
III--X are two views of one language, and a third --- the production
system of Parts XI--XII --- now exists: an elaborator, a compiler to an
executable IR and a `no_std` Rust core, a daemon, an IDE service and the
Studio authoring environment with its Formula Composer. What has
#emph[not] changed since the first draft is that no user study has been
run: every statement in this document about what designers find natural
is a hypothesis (Part XV).

== The Representation Problem
<the-representation-problem>
=== The target user is not a programmer with fewer syntax skills
<the-target-user-is-not-a-programmer-with-fewer-syntax-skills>
Many low-code and visual programming systems reduce textual syntax while
preserving the underlying computational ontology: variables,
assignments, loops, callbacks, functions, transitions, and scheduling.
For software developers this can be convenient. For industrial
designers, however, the dominant difficulty is often not syntax but
#emph[semantic translation]. The designer begins with a product
statement such as “while the cup is held, brightness follows tilt” and
must translate it into implementation machinery.

BDL therefore follows a stronger criterion: a surface primitive should
be exposed only when it corresponds to a concept that is independently
meaningful in the design task. A mutable accumulator used to count
samples is generally not such a concept; “three pickup events within ten
minutes” is. A polling loop is generally not; “while the product is
held” is. A callback is not; “when the button is pressed” is.

The language should directly expose concepts, time-varying quantities,
discrete occurrences, typed mappings, conditions, behavioral contexts,
temporal relations, physical outputs, and safety constraints. By default
it should hide program counters, threads, callbacks, continuations,
clock variables, and bus transactions. These may remain inspectable in
an expert or debugging view, but they are not the primary design medium.

=== A flow graph is a dependency view, not a program counter
<a-flow-graph-is-a-dependency-view-not-a-program-counter>
BDL uses a flow-like canvas because causal and functional paths are
useful visual structures. The arrows do #strong[not] mean “execute the
left node and then the right node.” They mean that the target
relationship depends on the source relationship or value.

Consider the procedural decomposition:

```text
[Cup picked up]
      |
[Read tilt]
      |
[Compute L = f(theta)]
      |
[Set LED brightness]
```

This decomposition is rejected as a primary design representation
because the “read,” “compute,” and “set” nodes are artifacts of an
execution model. The corresponding BDL view is a `Held` context
containing a mapping from `Tilt` to `Brightness`. The formula is a
property of that mapping, and the realization layer later binds the
mapping's value to a physical light output.

The distinction matters because it changes what the designer edits. In a
procedure-centric editor, changing an implementation may require
rewriting steps and intermediate state. In BDL, changing a transfer
function edits the definition of one relationship while preserving the
surrounding product logic. This is not only a matter of presentation.
Realizing or refining one declaration leaves every other declaration's
typing untouched, and leaves every commitment that was already
discharged in place, provided the evidence for those commitments does
not depend on what was still unknown.

=== Cognitive budget
<cognitive-budget>
The surface language must remain intentionally small. Each additional
primitive has a cost in learnability, visibility, consistency, and
error-proneness, all familiar concerns in the Cognitive Dimensions
tradition @green1996cognitive. BDL therefore uses a #emph[cognitive
budget]: a new visible construct is justified only when it captures a
distinct design concept that cannot be expressed cleanly as a property
of an existing construct.

The same budget was applied to the kernel, under a stricter test. A
kernel construct earns its place only if removing it makes some design
either unrepresentable or ambiguous, and the argument for each is a
theorem or a counterexample rather than a preference. Several constructs
that the surface exposes as distinct concepts turned out, under that
test, to be derived forms. Every temporal modifier reduces to one delay
primitive. Every cross-domain policy reduces to one transport primitive
plus ordinary data. Every output-selection policy reduces to ordinary
computation upstream of a single drive edge.

=== Progressive disclosure is a semantic property
<progressive-disclosure-is-a-semantic-property>
A design tool can be visually simple and still force premature
decisions. BDL instead treats progressive disclosure as part of the
language semantics. A design may contain a declaration whose realization
is intentionally absent. Later steps may refine the same declaration
with mathematical properties, a body, a clock domain, an output binding,
and a target board. Each step is either a #emph[refinement], which
preserves everything previously established, or an #emph[edit], which is
permitted but reopens the validation of dependents. That distinction is
made precise in the section on declarations, and it is the organizing
principle of the interaction model.

== Scope and non-goals
<scope-and-non-goals>
#strong[In scope.] A designer-facing language for the behavior of
physical products --- concepts, relationships, timing, outputs,
components --- with a formal kernel small enough to reason about and a
production toolchain that follows it: authoring in a graph and in text,
checking while incomplete, simulation, target-relative deployment
validation, and code generation for a deterministic embedded core. The
formal development's job is to say what the kernel must contain and to
reject what it need not; the production system's job is to build
everything the kernel deliberately omits --- the elaborator, the
tooling, the execution path --- without redefining the language.

#strong[Out of scope, by decision.] BDL is not a general-purpose
programming language: there is no general recursion, no user-defined
type abstraction, no effect system, and the equation language is total
and first-order in its data (Part V). It is not a continuous-time or
hybrid modelling language: time is a global tick with named domains, and
continuous dynamics are outside the model (Part VII). It is not a
systems-engineering framework: requirements, verification of physical
properties beyond typing and dimension, and electrical or thermal
budgets are not modelled (Part X). It is not a runtime with scheduling
policy: the strictly-before rule removes the scheduler from the
semantics, and the generated core has no tasks (Part XI). It does not
verify its own compiler: the production code is held to the model by
tests, and the refinement proof is an open item (Part XV).

#strong[Not claimed.] That designers think signature-first; that Studio
is usable; that the kernel is minimal in any absolute sense; that any
theorem says anything about Rust or Dart. Each of these is either an
open empirical question or a restriction on a claim, and the text says
which wherever it arises.

= Part II --- The Designer-Facing Language
<part-ii-the-designer-facing-language>
This Part is the language as a designer meets it in Studio and in a
`.bdl` file at the production snapshot, with the vocabulary the product
uses. Every construct here is a surface form; Parts III--X state which
forms are kernel primitives and which are derived, and Part XII
describes how Studio draws them. Two kinds of surface construct are kept
apart throughout: those that exist in production (#strong[production
implemented and tested]) and those that were designed, reduced to the
kernel in the formal development, and are not yet offered by the product
(#strong[design recommendation]\; production's ISS-0010 tracks the
largest of them). The Part ends with one end-to-end scenario and the
states a design passes through.

For every mechanism the same five questions are answered, here or in the
Part that owns it: what problem the designer experiences, what concept
the language exposes, what formal mechanism supports it, what
implementation owns it, and what complexity is hidden.

== Concepts
<concepts>
The first-class object is a #strong[concept], not a raw scalar: `Tilt`,
`Brightness`, `Temperature`, `CupContact`, `MotorAngle`. A concept has a
#strong[value form] --- a quantity with a physical kind and a unit
(`Tilt : Angle`), on/off, a count, a collection of another concept's
values, a grouped value, an optional value --- or none yet (#emph[decide
later]); it may carry a description, a preferred display unit and, for a
quantity, a declaration that it is #strong[ordered]. Its identity is
what the language tracks: `Tilt` and `MotorAngle` may both be angles and
are never interchangeable, and a link between sockets of different
concepts is refused before any formula exists.

#emph[Designer problem:] the workshop cost of Part I --- a stable fact
about a value with no place to live. #emph[Language concept:] the named
concept with its value form. #emph[Formal mechanism:] the nominal type
`sem s` and the write-once representation binding Θ (Part IV).
#emph[Owner:] `bdl-model` (identity, value form), `bdl-elab` (Θ),
`bdl-check`. #emph[Hidden:] the type constructor, the grant, the
representation; the canvas shows a hue and a socket shape.

In text:

```
concept Tilt : Angle
concept Brightness : Scalar
ordered concept Severity : Scalar
concept Readings : List<Tilt>
```

== Relationships and the three roles
<relationships-and-the-three-roles>
A #strong[relationship] is created from a #strong[signature]: what it
reads and what it produces.

```
mapping dimByTilt : Tilt -> Brightness        // reads Tilt, produces Brightness
mapping brightness : () -> Brightness         // reads nothing, produces Brightness
mapping tilt : () -> Tilt                     // reads nothing, no formula: a Source
```

The keyword is `mapping`\; the product word is #emph[relationship]. A
relationship has a stable identity, a display name, a signature, an
optional #strong[formula] (its realization) and, when it lives in a
timing domain, a domain (`@interaction`). Every relationship has one
canonical type `domain(inputs) -> B`, with the empty product `()` as the
domain of a relationship that reads nothing; `mapping f : B` is accepted
as legacy shorthand with a hint and a fix, and `f`, `f()` and `f(())`
are one reference (ADR-0029, Part IX).

What a relationship #emph[is] is one of three #strong[roles], derived
from two authored facts --- whether it reads anything, and whether it
has a realization --- never persisted, never chosen, never an identity
(ADR-0032 (FVD-0118), production's `bdl_model::RelationshipRole`):

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (20%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%),
    align: (auto,auto,auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([role], [when], [has a value at a tick?], [how a
      formula uses it], [may drive an output?],),
    table.hline(),
    [#strong[Rule]], [it reads something (its type is an arrow)], [no
    --- it is a function], [applied: `dimByTilt(tilt)`], [no --- its
    type is an arrow],
    [#strong[Value]], [it reads nothing and has a formula], [yes], [by
    reference: `brightness`], [yes, when its concept and domain are the
    output's],
    [#strong[Source]], [it reads nothing and has no formula], [yes, once
    the environment supplies it], [by reference: `tilt`], [yes, on the
    same condition],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The rule has one home, the model, and is stated on every projection
(protocol 0.20); Studio maps the enum and re-derives nothing.
#emph[States] --- declared, open, invalid, valid, not applied, driven,
bound, clocked --- vary within a role and never move it. A Source is
complete, not unfinished: nothing is missing from it, the environment
provides its value once per activation, and it is drawn with a boundary
bar on the environment side and the word #emph[Source], never dashed.
The word #emph[sensor] is not used: a button state and an external
configuration value are Sources too, and what realizes a Source is
deployment's business (Part IX).

#emph[Designer problem:] stating that brightness depends on tilt before
deciding how; distinguishing a value the product computes from one it
observes. #emph[Language concept:] signature, relationship, the three
roles. #emph[Formal mechanism:] a declaration with an interface and an
optional realization (Part III); the unit-domain normalization and the
source role as a realization state (Part IX). #emph[Owner:] `bdl-model`
(`MappingBlock::role`), `bdl-compiler` (`MappingAnalysis.role`), the
daemon (`MappingView.role`). #emph[Hidden:] currying, unit elimination,
the kernel's single input stream.

== Incomplete designs are legal
<incomplete-designs-are-legal>
Stopping between declaring a relationship and defining it costs nothing,
and the product has several such stopping states, each drawn and
explained rather than flagged as an error:

- a #strong[declared] rule --- a relationship that reads something and
  has no formula --- drawn dashed with the one word #emph[declared]\;
  the design around it is checked as far as it can be, and other
  relationships may already apply it;
- a Source with #strong[no value yet] in the simulator --- the input
  control is drawn empty with a dashed outline; nothing is defaulted to
  `false` or `0`, and the run does not step until every Source has a
  value;
- an #strong[open] formula --- one that waits on a concept whose value
  form is not yet chosen --- a solid node with a hollow socket and the
  sentence #emph[checked once Temperature's value is decided]\;
- a rule #strong[nothing applies] --- `reactive.rule_unapplied`, an
  informational finding, never an error --- drawn with a hollow output
  socket and the words #emph[not applied], with the fix `rule.apply`
  offered: #emph[Add a value that applies dimByTilt], which creates
  `brightness : () -> Brightness = dimByTilt(tilt)` when each read
  concept has exactly one producing value, offers a choice when one has
  several, and is blocked with the reason when one has none;
- a formula with a #strong[slot] `?` --- an expression not yet written,
  ordinary draft text that is saved with the file and refused by
  elaboration until filled (Part XII);
- a file that #strong[does not build yet] --- the text is kept as typed,
  the graph shows the last version that did build, and the reasons are
  listed (ADR-0023, ADR-0030).

#emph[Designer problem:] conventional tools have no legal position for
an undefined relationship, so a signature-first strategy cannot be
adopted even when it would help. #emph[Formal mechanism:] an unresolved
declaration is a declaration whose realization is `none` and clients are
typed against its interface (Part III). Whether designers use these
positions is an #strong[open empirical question] (Part XV).

== Formulas
<formulas>
A formula is written in a small expression language: arithmetic and
comparison, `&&` / `||` / `!` (drawn as #emph[and], #emph[or],
#emph[not] in the Composer), `if … then … else`, `match` over on/off,
optional and numeric values, `let`, calls of the #strong[equation
library] (`clamp`, `min`, `max`, `inRange`, `any`, `all`, `map`,
`filter`, `sum`, `zip`, `contains`, `getOrElse`, …), rules `x => …` as
arguments, membership `x in [a, b, c]`, list and pair literals, quantity
literals with units (`90 deg`), memory `delay(init, e)`, carrying across
domains `sync(domain, init, e)`, and the natural forms:

```
all reading in readings: reading in 10 deg .. 45 deg
map r in readings: r / 90 deg
tilt ?? 0 deg
```

The formula's inputs are the concepts of its signature by their names; a
formula attached to a relationship that produces `Brightness` is written
as a scalar expression and the elaborator supplies the wrapping ---
there is no constructor to type, and no other concept can be
manufactured inside it. Units belong to literals: `90 deg` is the
designer's, `tilt` is a `Tilt` and carries no unit of its own; changing
the unit of a literal with the quantity kept is a spelling change,
editing its coordinate is a change of meaning (Part VI). The natural
forms are one-way spellings of library equations: a binder local is the
equation's lambda parameter, a range is `inRange`, `??` is `getOrElse`,
and nothing new is evaluated (Part V).

The #strong[Formula Composer] shows the same formula as the compiler
reads it --- reference chips with socket glyphs, literals as a
coordinate and a unit pop-up, dashed slots, operators, calls, binders
over an indented body, a choice as `if` with its condition over `then`
and `else` --- with, for the selected component, the compiler's
expectation and its reason (#emph[Expected: an angle, because an angle ÷
an angle = a dimensionless quantity]) and the candidates of that kind.
Every structured action is a text edit of the same formula. Richer forms
--- `let`, `match`, blocks, rules as arguments, collection literals ---
are drawn as text inside the Composer and edited as text (Part XII).

== Time
<time>
The designer sees two kinds of temporal thing: a #strong[quantity] that
has a value whenever its domain is active, and an #strong[occurrence]
that may or may not be present at an activation. Underneath, the
distinction is not one of type: every relationship is a stream under the
tick semantics, and an occurrence is an optional value (Part VII).

#strong[Memory.] `delay(init, e)` is last activation's value of `e`, and
`init` before there was one. Every remembered value has an explicit
first value, and the tool asks for it --- what brightness does the lamp
show before it has ever been tilted? --- because it is a product
decision, not an implementation default. A relationship that depends
instantaneously on itself is reported at the loop, in the names of the
relationships, with the suggestion to remember one of them.

#strong[Timing domains.] "Contact and orientation move with the
interaction; temperature moves with the environment" is a statement
about which values update together, not about how often. It is recorded
by naming a #strong[timing domain] on a relationship (`@interaction`),
with no rate attached. The first time a relationship reads across
domains the tool stops at that reference: the two values update in
different rhythms, and it asks how the reader should see the source ---
as the last value the source produced, with a stated value to use before
the source has ever reported (`sync(environment, init, e)`, chosen in
the #emph[Starts at] sheet), or by moving the reader into the source's
domain. Both are legitimate designs; the initial value of a safety
interlock is exactly the decision worth writing down. Rates belong to
deployment.

#strong[Temporal modifiers and contexts --- designed, not offered.] The
earlier draft of BDL (archived in `paper/archive/`) described temporal
phrases as qualifiers on relationships --- `p for 300 ms`,
`after e by 2 s`, `while p`, `until e`, `since e`, `once e`,
`every 1 s`, `rise p`, `previous x`, `count e`, `hold x e` --- and
#strong[contexts] (StateHandlers): named product situations, activated
by a condition or entered and left by occurrences, containing a local
flow graph and nested contexts, so that "while the cup is held,
brightness follows tilt" is a region rather than a transition table. The
formal development elaborated and executed each of these over the one
memory primitive (Part VII): `previous`, `hold`, `count`, `since`,
`once`, `every` and `rise` as self-delayed declaration shapes; a context
as an activation declaration, an entry edge, gated and reset local
state, an inactive default, and a conditional in the one relationship
that drives an output. The reduction is #strong[formally characterized
for the tested cases] --- condition-scoped activation, entry,
reset-on-entry state, inactive default, event-latched activation with
exit-wins, state-local output selection, nested selection with an output
--- and contexts with their own timing domain and independently clocked
nesting were not examined (FVI-0009). Production offers neither the
phrases nor contexts at the snapshot: a designer writes `delay` and
`sync` directly, and the shapes above are written out by hand
(ISS-0010). Their surface is a #strong[design recommendation] carried
here so that when they are built they are built as elaborations and not
as kernel constructs.

#emph[Designer problem:] history without explicit state; different
rhythms without a scheduler. #emph[Language concept:] memory with a
first value; named timing domains; carrying across domains with a first
value. #emph[Formal mechanism:] `delay`, `sync`, strictly-before, the
domain judgment (Part VII). #emph[Owner:] `bdl-reactive`, `bdl-lower`.
#emph[Hidden:] the tick, the schedule, the two-phase step.

== Physical outputs
<physical-outputs>
A design computes values; it does not move hardware. Physical effect
happens only through an #strong[output] ---
`output light : Brightness @interaction` --- and one #strong[drive]
connecting it to exactly one relationship that produces its concept in
its domain: a Value, or a Source (a value the environment supplies may
be passed straight through to a light); never a Rule, whose type is an
arrow. Where several behaviors would influence one output --- a safety
override and an interaction --- they are combined by an ordinary
relationship that becomes the one driver, and the combination rule
(priority, blend, maximum, clamp) is written in the design where it can
be read. A second drive on the same output is refused as
#emph[contested], with the message on the output, in the product's
words: #emph[this output already has a driver; combine the two
brightness values before connecting it]. An output with no driver is
reported until the design is executable.

Below the output is the #strong[device] that realizes it on a board
(`device pwmLight : pwm_channel for light`), and below that the board's
pins; neither enters the behavior model (Part X).

#emph[Designer problem:] two behaviors reaching for one light, and a
runtime rule chosen silently. #emph[Formal mechanism:] nominal sink
identity, the write-once drive edge, `DriveWF`, `SingleDriver`,
`CompleteOutputs` (Part IX). #emph[Owner:] `bdl-output`. #emph[Hidden:]
nothing --- the point is that the arbitration is on the canvas.

== Behaviors, components and systems
<behaviors-components-and-systems>
Relationships can be gathered into a #strong[behavior] --- a named
group, drawn as a box, collapsible to its boundary sockets, moved,
merged and split with no change to the design and no re-check (ADR-0019
(FVD-0074 … FVD-0082)). #emph[Package as Component] turns a behavior
into a #strong[component]: a reusable design with a #strong[promise] ---
what it requires, provides and takes as a parameter, which timing
domains it is written against, which concepts it shares with the system
--- inferred from the boundary and widened by the designer, never
narrowed below what the members read. An #strong[instance] is one use of
a component with fresh identity; a #strong[binding] connects a provided
port or a value to a required port or an open relationship, directly in
one domain or carried across domains with a first value; a
#strong[version] is a copy with the same promise. Every project is a
#strong[system] --- a design with no components is the degenerate one
--- and the flat design every check runs on is derived, never persisted
(ADR-0021, ADR-0022 (FVD-0064 … FVD-0073)).

```
component AdaptiveLamp {
  use concept Tilt
  use concept Brightness
  param clock main
  requires tiltValue : Tilt @main
  mapping dimByTilt : Tilt -> Brightness
  dimByTilt(t) = t / (90 deg)
  provides brightness : Brightness @main
  brightness() = dimByTilt(tiltValue)
}
instance lamp : AdaptiveLamp { main = interaction }
bind lamp.tiltValue = tilt
```

Inside a component, the relationship behind a required port is a Source
of the body --- provided through the port --- and Studio wears the
port's word for it; an unbound required port of an instance is a Source
of the system, a simulation input. The role is a fact of one design, and
the same declaration can have a different role in the body, in the flat
design and at the top level (production's relationship-roles matrix;
Theorem H of Part VIII).

#emph[Designer problem:] reuse without copying; organizing a large
design before deciding its interfaces. #emph[Formal mechanism:] groups
as authoring metadata proved transparent; components as templates
instantiated with fresh identity and bound by ordinary realization
steps; flattening (Part VIII). #emph[Owner:] `.bdl/authoring.json`
(groups), `bdl-system`. #emph[Hidden:] renaming, the origin map, the
flat design.

== The Standard Library
<the-standard-library>
The Library is an #strong[authoring catalogue]: items that create
ordinary objects in the design in one transaction. A #emph[Concept] item
creates a concept with its value form; a #emph[Source] item creates a
concept and a `() -> concept` relationship with no formula --- a Source
by the derived rule, exactly as one made by hand. The library carries no
role and no flag; instantiating an item is the same edit sequence a
designer could perform, undone as one step. Item names and descriptions
are localized by Studio; identifiers never are. The Library is not a
device catalogue: what realizes a Source on a board is a deployment
concern (Part IX), and the device catalogue that concern needs does not
exist at the snapshot.

== Supplied computation --- designed, not built
<supplied-computation-designed-not-built>
Some behavior is easier to state as code than as a diagram: recursive
filters, estimators, self-tuning controllers. The design admits
computation blocks written in the host language behind a signature the
designer places first --- `smooth : Distance -> Distance` as the
specification an engineer works against --- with the properties the
kernel cannot derive for supplied code (determinism, totality, range,
state size, the rate it was designed for) declared as validation
obligations, and with one rule the kernel does enforce: supplied code
may not drive an output (ADR-0005 (FVD-0050 … FVD-0056)). The trust
boundary is designed (`docs/architecture/component-boundary.md` in
production); no implementation exists.

== A representative scenario
<a-representative-scenario>
A table lamp responds to being handled: when picked up and tilted its
brightness follows the tilt; when set down it holds the last brightness.
A heater in its base keeps a drink warm, with a temperature sensor
beside it; above a warning temperature the lamp pulses, above a critical
temperature the heater must switch off regardless of anything else. The
product is to run on an Arduino Nano, chosen last. The scenario is small
and exercises everything the model offers: relationships known before
their formulas, history without explicit state, a safety condition
competing with an interaction for one output, two rhythms, and a board
met last. The common path below is what Studio does at the snapshot; the
two places where the designed vocabulary goes beyond the product are
marked.

#strong[Starting from intent.] The designer names `Tilt`, `Brightness`,
`Temperature`, `Held` --- none a sensor or a number --- and adds from
the Library the #emph[Tilt Sensor] and #emph[Temperature Sensor] items,
each of which creates its concept and a relationship with no formula in
one step --- renamed here to `tilt : () -> Tilt` and
`temperature : () -> Temperature` --- each a Source by the derived rule,
each complete, each provided by the environment. The first relationship
is drawn from `Tilt` to `Brightness`\; it becomes
`dimByTilt : Tilt -> Brightness`, a declared rule, dashed, not an error.
The design now says that brightness depends on tilt and nothing about
how. A property such as #emph[increasing in tilt] cannot yet be recorded
--- commitments are a kernel slot with no production authoring (Part
III) --- but a link from `Tilt` to a motor-angle concept would already
be refused.

#strong[Refining locally.] Opening `dimByTilt` shows the Formula
Composer. The designer chooses #emph[Function → clamp], fills the slots
--- `clamp(tilt ÷ 90 deg, 0, 1)` --- with the expectation and the units
offered at each slot, and the rule checks. The canvas still shows one
arrow. The rule is #emph[not applied] until something applies it; the
offered fix creates `brightness : () -> Brightness = dimByTilt(tilt)`, a
Value, which is what the simulator shows and what an output can read.

#strong[History.] #emph[\(designed vocabulary)] The phrase
`hold while not Held` on the wire is the temporal-modifier surface, not
offered at the snapshot; the designer writes the shape the phrase would
elaborate to ---
`brightness() = if held then dimByTilt(tilt) else delay(0, brightness)`
--- and is asked for the first value.

#strong[Contexts.] #emph[\(designed vocabulary)] A `Held` region
containing `dimByTilt` is the context surface, not offered; the
activation condition is an ordinary on/off relationship and the gating
is written in the driver, as above.

#strong[One output, one driver.]
`output light : Brightness @interaction` is driven by `brightness`. The
warning pulse, `warmPulse`, cannot be connected to `light` as well; the
repaired design has one more relationship, `lampTarget`, whose formula
says whether the pulse takes priority while warm, or the maximum is
shown, and `lampTarget` drives `light`. The heater's cutoff is the same
shape: `heaterTarget` forces the demand to zero above the critical
temperature, visibly, upstream of the output.

#strong[Two rhythms.] `temperature` updates with the environment, `tilt`
and `held` with the interaction: two timing domains, `@environment` and
`@interaction`, no rates. `heaterTarget @interaction` reads the critical
condition from `@environment`\; the tool stops at the reference and the
designer chooses #emph[carry across, starting at released] ---
`sync(environment, false, critical)` --- writing down what the interlock
does before the first temperature reading.

#strong[Choosing a board.] The outputs are given devices --- the light a
PWM channel, the heater a switched load --- and the Deploy page, on
selecting a Nano, derives what the design needs and proposes a
placement, or reports on the requirement that could not be placed and
names what occupies each candidate pin. Nothing on the canvas changes; a
larger board places the same design; a manual pin is a constraint on
placement, not a change to the design (Part X).

#strong[Simulating.] The Simulate page lists the Sources --- `tilt`,
`temperature`, `held` --- as the inputs, refuses to step until each has
a value, and shows every Value and every output per tick, with a probe
naming for each concept what carries it and, for a rule, where it is
applied.

== What the workspace says
<what-the-workspace-says>
@fig:levels lists the states a design passes through, as the product
reports them; each answers what is unresolved, what is settled and what
can be done next.

#figure(
  {
    let row(level, check, layer) = (

  },
  kind: image, supplement: [Figure],
  caption: [States a design passes through, as the workspace reports them. All but the last are properties of the design alone; the last is a property of the design together with a board, and is re-established whenever either changes.],
) <fig:levels>
A relationship that is declared but not defined is shown as open, and
the design around it is checked as far as it can be. A definition that
does not check is marked at the definition, in the vocabulary of the
relationship. A loop or a missing first value is marked at the wire. A
missing driver is marked at the output. A conflict on the board is
marked on the Deploy page, at the requirement that could not be placed.
#emph[Feasible] is separate from everything above it because it is the
only state that depends on something other than the design: six PWM
channels fit a Nano, a seventh may not, and nothing about the first six
changes.

== Looking underneath
<looking-underneath>
Most of the time the compact surface is all a designer sees.
#strong[Explain], a collapsed disclosure at the end of the inspector,
opens the selected object to what it became: the canonical type and the
kernel interface, `role: Source | Rule | Value`, the Core term a formula
elaborated to, the memory cell behind a `delay`, the transport and the
tick at which a source was last read, the drive edge and the
requirements derived from a device. It is where the kernel vocabulary is
allowed to appear, for the engineer who receives the design and wants to
know exactly what was generated, and it is the answer to the
hidden-elaboration risk of Part XV: the surface stays simple because
elaboration does real work, and the work is inspectable rather than
mysterious.

= Part III --- The Core Declaration Model
<part-iii-the-core-declaration-model>
== Method
<method>
The kernel was obtained by a method, and the method is part of the
record. Each phase of the development took a family of candidate
constructs from the earlier draft, formalized the smallest plausible
version and its alternatives in Lean 4 without external libraries, and
attacked each with the same questions. What does it reject that the
others accept? What does it accept that it should not? Is it a special
case of another? Which operations on a design are refinements under it,
and which are edits? Constructs were promoted from the experiment
modules to the kernel only after surviving, and the theorems about them
were re-proved in the promoted form.

The formal development labels each conclusion with one of six strengths
--- formally proved, formally rejected by counterexample, reduction by
proof, tested formulation redundant, engineering preference, not ruled
out --- and this document maps them onto the five labels of the front
matter: the first three are #strong[formally proved] (a counterexample
and a reduction are theorems), the fourth and fifth are #strong[informed
by FV] or #strong[design recommendation] according to whether a
mechanized example bounded the choice, and the last is stated as open.
Nothing in the development is a proven impossibility, and "minimal"
always means minimal among the tested designs.

== Scale and trust base
<scale-and-trust-base>
The development builds with Lean 4.33.1 with no `sorry`. The axioms used
by every theorem are propositional extensionality and quotient
soundness, the latter only through function extensionality and the
choice-free rational quotient of Part VI; classical choice is absent,
and each phase re-audited the whole development for it. As of Phase 14
the sources are 57 modules: 11 in `Core`, 12 in `Behavior`, 13 in
`Surface`, 2 in `Validation`, and 19 experiment modules holding
alternatives, counterexamples and executed examples. Every trace,
assignment, unsatisfiability result and executed example reported here
was obtained by running a proved-sound interpreter or solver inside the
proof checker. Several theorems are recorded as trivial by definition
--- the typing half of client stability is a one-liner, and the
well-formedness of a refinement target is unused because the invariant
was moved into the definition --- and they are reported as such rather
than presented as content.

== From Surface to Kernel: Architecture
<from-surface-to-kernel-architecture>
The system has three layers, and the boundary between them is the main
architectural result of the formal development.

  kind: image, supplement: [Figure],
  caption: [The three layers. Typing consults only the type view of declarations and the representation view of concepts; validation may consult commitments, evidence, and the target; the surface is derived forms over the kernel.],
) <fig:arch>
The #strong[surface] is what the designer authors: concepts,
relationships, temporal modifiers, contexts, device bindings, units,
generic equations, groups and components, and display names. Everything
in it elaborates to kernel objects, and the elaboration is
one-directional: the kernel never needs to recover surface structure.

The #strong[kernel] is the formal object of Parts III--IX. It consists
of an environment of declarations, a typing judgment, a tick-indexed
evaluation relation over one or several clock domains, a domain
judgment, and a small number of global well-formedness conditions: every
realization satisfies its interface, the instantaneous dependency graph
is acyclic, every reference respects domains, and every physical output
has at most one driver. The typing judgment reads only the #emph[type
view] of declarations --- their expected types --- and the
#emph[representation view] of concepts. It does not read realizations,
commitments, evidence, clocks, or bindings.

The #strong[validation layer] is everything that may depend on more than
types. It discharges the commitments a declaration makes, and it decides
whether a design fits a target board. Two kinds of evidence live here
and are kept apart. Evidence that is meant to survive refinement --- a
monotonicity commitment discharged compositionally through the
commitments of other declarations --- must be stable under monotone
extension of the environment, and the kernel imposes that condition.
Evidence that is not meant to survive refinement --- the existence of a
pin assignment on a particular board --- is re-established after every
change and is never merged with the first kind.

@fig:arch shows the layers as they stand after Phase 14; the kernel band
also holds list and product data with one recursor (Part V) and the
behavior-component constructs (Part VIII), the surface band holds the
deployment construction of Part IX, and the validation band holds
deployment capacity (Part X). What is notable about the arrangement is
how much of the earlier draft of BDL is absent from the kernel band.
Reactive types, event types, effect rows, action requests, policy
transformations, and a five-phase tick with a resolve step were all part
of the draft kernel. Each was removed because it either added no
rejection the smaller kernel lacked, or made a design decision on the
designer's behalf that should have been visible in the design. The
states of @fig:levels are the designer-facing face of the same
structure: #emph[declared] and #emph[type-valid] are the typing judgment
and satisfaction; #emph[temporally valid] is causality;
#emph[clock-consistent] is the domain judgment; #emph[output-complete]
is the single-driver and completeness conditions;
#emph[hardware-feasible] is the validation layer's solver. Each is
decidable for finite designs.

== Declarations, Interfaces, and Refinement
<declarations-interfaces-and-refinement>
The foundational kernel object is a #strong[design declaration],

$ upright("DesignDecl") = chevron.l thick & italic(i d) : upright("DeclId")\,\
 & italic(i n t e r f a c e) : upright("DeclInterface")\,\
 & italic(r e a l i z a t i o n) : upright("Option") thick upright("Expr") thick chevron.r\, $

where an interface is an expected type together with a set of public
commitments:

$ upright("DeclInterface") = chevron.l thick & italic(e x p e c t e d T y p e) : upright("Ty")\,\
 & italic(c o m m i t m e n t s) : upright("PropertyId")^(*) thick chevron.r . $

A design is an environment
$Delta : upright("DeclId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("DesignDecl")$.
An unresolved declaration is one whose realization is `none`\; nothing
else distinguishes it. Display names are not part of the kernel.

=== Typing through the type view
<typing-through-the-type-view>
Terms refer to declarations by identity, $upright("declRef") thick d$.
The typing judgment $Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r e : tau$ takes a
concept environment $Theta$ and a grant $G$, both introduced in the next
section, and a declaration environment $Delta$ which it consults through
exactly one projection, the type view $Delta^(upright(t y))\(d\)$, the
expected type of $d$ if declared:

$ frac(Delta^(upright(t y))\(d\)= upright("some") thick tau, Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r upright("declRef") thick d : tau) . $

This is the only rule that reads $Delta$. A client of $d$ is therefore
typed against $d$'s interface and never against its body, whether or not
a body exists. Inference is syntax-directed and decidable, and an
inference function is proved sound, complete, and unique against the
judgment.

=== Satisfaction, well-formedness, and refinement
<satisfaction-well-formedness-and-refinement>
A realization $e$ #strong[satisfies] an interface $S$ when it has the
expected type under the grant of that type and discharges every
commitment:

$  & upright("Satisfies") thick italic(e v) thick Theta thick Delta thick Gamma thick e thick S thick :=\
 & quad Theta\;Delta\;upright("Grant.of")\(S . italic(t y)\)\;Gamma tack.r e : S . italic(t y)\
 & quad and thick forall p in S . italic(c o m m i t m e n t s) . thick italic(e v) thick Delta thick e thick p\, $

where $S . italic(t y)$ abbreviates the expected type. Here
$italic(e v) : upright("DeclEnv") arrow.r upright("Expr") arrow.r upright("PropertyId") arrow.r upright("Prop")$
is an abstract #strong[evidence] relation supplied by the validation
layer. It takes the environment as an argument because compositional
discharge needs it: “$A$ is monotone because $B$ is committed to be
monotone” consults $B$'s interface. A design is #strong[globally well
formed] when every stored declaration sits under its own identity and
its realization, if any, satisfies its interface in that design.

Interfaces are ordered by monotone refinement: $S subset.eq.sq S'$ when
the expected type is unchanged and the commitments of $S$ are contained
in those of $S'$. A declaration takes a refinement step in one of three
ways. An unresolved declaration may have its interface refined; an
unresolved declaration may be realized with a satisfying body; and a
realized declaration may have its interface strengthened, provided the
body is re-verified against the new interface. The reflexive-transitive
closure of these steps is exactly the structural order together with
well-formedness of the target, where the structural order
$upright("DeclLeq")$ requires the same identity, interface refinement,
and a write-once realization, and
$upright("EnvRefines") thick Delta_1 thick Delta_2$ lifts it pointwise
while permitting new declarations.

=== Client stability
<client-stability>
Can a declaration be refined or realized without editing its clients,
and without invalidating what was previously established about them? The
answer has two halves with deliberately different hypotheses.

The typing half needs only the structural order. If $B$ is declared in
$Delta$ and $upright("DeclLeq") thick B thick B'$, then every typing
judgment in $Delta$ holds in $Delta\[B'\]$. This is a one-line
consequence of typing references through the type view, and it should be
read as such: its content is that the decision to let clients see
interfaces and never bodies is #emph[sufficient] for client stability.
It is also necessary. Change $B$'s expected type while keeping its
identity, and every client breaks.

The commitment half needs more. If $Delta$ is globally well formed, $B$
takes a refinement step whose side conditions are checked in $Delta$,
and the evidence relation is #strong[monotone] --- stable under
$upright("EnvRefines")$ --- then $Delta\[B'\]$ is globally well formed,
and the same holds for a whole lifecycle of $B$ checked against the
original environment. The monotonicity hypothesis was not part of the
original design. It appeared when the theorem was attacked. An evidence
relation that consults the #emph[absence] of information --- one that
discharges a property because a dependency is still unresolved, say ---
is destroyed by a perfectly valid realization step, and the
non-monotonicity of that evidence can be derived from the failure of
preservation. Any discharge mechanism intended to survive refinement
must therefore be positive in the environment.

=== Refinement versus edit
<refinement-versus-edit>
The preservation theorems cover refinement only. The table lists the
operations examined and their classification; each row is witnessed by
an example on a two-declaration design in which
$A : upright("nat") arrow.r upright("bool")$ is realized through an
unresolved $B : upright("nat") arrow.r upright("nat")$.

)
]
Two rows deserve comment. Dropping a commitment changes no type, so the
type checker is silent, yet $A$'s own commitment was discharged through
$B$'s and is now unsupported. Commitments are therefore part of the
interface in the same load-bearing sense as the expected type. That is a
stronger position than the earlier draft of the language took when it
described properties as merely attaching to a name. Detaching a
realization, which that draft permitted as an ordinary operation, is an
edit for the same reason: clients' typing is unaffected, but any
evidence that consulted the body is void. The kernel does not forbid
edits. It declines to promise anything about them, and the tool must
reopen the validation of transitive dependents.

=== What persistent identity is
<what-persistent-identity-is>
The earlier draft left open whether a persistent, referable identity for
an unresolved relationship is a novel abstraction. It is not. Every
theorem that mentions identity uses it only to make an update land on
the slot a reference resolves to, which is what a name does in any
environment-based semantics. The non-trivial content lies in the
environment order, and in the two facts that clients depend on it only
through the type view for typing and only through monotone evidence for
commitments. This is the familiar interface/implementation separation of
module signatures, of a parameter later given a definition, or of a
metavariable context with write-once assignment and fixed types,
together with a Kripke-style stability condition on evidence. What is
slightly non-standard is that the interface carries a growable
commitment set whose growth is a first-class operation on a
declared-but-undefined name, and that the kernel imposes a stability
condition on the validation layer. Neither is a new type-theoretic
mechanism, and no such claim is made.

== Where the rest of the kernel is described
<where-the-rest-of-the-kernel-is-described>
The declaration model above is the frame every later result is stated
in. Semantic identity, representation binding and dimensions are Part
IV; the data core, the equation library and the natural surface Part V;
units and charts Part VI; the reactive semantics, clock domains and
buffering Part VII; behavior components and groups Part VIII; the
environment boundaries --- the canonical type `() -> B`, the source
role, logical outputs, provision and realization --- Part IX; hardware
and capacity validation Part X. The minimality verdict for each
construct is given where the construct is discussed and gathered in Part
XIV.

= Part IV --- Semantic Identity and Physical Quantities
<part-iv-semantic-identity-and-physical-quantities>
The kernel of Part III types declarations and lets clients depend on
interfaces; it says nothing yet about what a type #emph[means]. This
Part adds the two things a product concept carries that a number does
not --- an identity that survives representation, and a physical
dimension --- and shows, by the counterexamples that decided each, why
structural numeric identity is insufficient, why observation and
construction of a concept's representation must be treated differently,
and why dimensions live in the types of operators rather than in a
separate judgment. The capability audit that fixed what #emph[equality]
and #emph[order] mean on concept values is in Part V, because it was
forced by the equation library; its conclusion --- equality on data,
order on quantities and declared-ordered concepts only --- belongs to
this Part's picture of a concept and is restated there.

== Nominal concepts
<nominal-concepts>
Suppose concepts were represented only by their representation types, so
that `Tilt` and `MotorAngle` are both numbers. Then the wire
`motorTarget := tiltSensor` is well typed and the design is globally
well formed, because nothing in the model records the distinction. This
baseline was built, the wire was accepted, and three ways of recording
the distinction were then tried against it.

The one that survived is a single nominal type constructor over an
internal identity:

$ upright("SemanticId")\,#h(2em) upright("Ty") in.rev upright("sem") thick s . $

Two distinct identities are distinct types regardless of representation,
so the invalid wire is rejected by the ordinary rules of the simply
typed calculus with no additional judgment. An explicit relationship
between concepts, `tiltToMotor : Tilt -> MotorAngle`, is an ordinary
declaration of arrow type --- a design relationship that is itself
signature-first and may remain unresolved --- and it appears in the term
wherever a crossing occurs. It is not a cast, coercion, or conversion;
the kernel has no such mechanism.

Semantic identity is independent of declaration identity, of display
name, of dimension, and of hardware, and each independence was tested
rather than assumed. A rename preserves identity, whereas a model in
which the name #emph[is] the identity makes renaming destructive.
Treating a concept as an ordinary declaration admits two category
errors: the concept becomes usable as a value, and it can be realized by
a number. Keeping identity out of the type as interface metadata,
checked by a direct-wire rule, is evaded by $eta$-expansion, since
`(λx. x) tilt` has the same flow with no direct wire. A compositional
role judgment strong enough to close that gap has the rule shapes of
typing over types-with-`sem`, and the one such formulation examined
duplicated nominal typing without benefit. Flow-sensitive or relational
semantic analyses were not formalized and are not ruled out; nominal
`sem` is the smallest mechanism among the designs that were tried, not
the only one possible.

Erasing all semantic identities is sound --- a well-typed semantic term
is well typed at its representation --- and the baseline is exactly what
erasure leaves. Generated code is thus ordinary code; the semantic layer
has no runtime residue.

== Representation binding and the grant
<representation-binding-and-the-grant>
Nominal identity alone leaves semantic values opaque. Without a way to
observe a representation and construct a value, no mapping can be
realized by a formula; under nominal typing alone a semantic value can
only originate from a declaration of semantic type. That is the right
state before representation is added. The question is how to add it
without destroying what identity just bought.

The obvious form --- global
$upright("rep")_s : upright("sem") thick s arrow.r R$ and
$upright("mk")_s : R arrow.r upright("sem") thick s$ available to every
term --- destroys it immediately.
$lambda x . thick upright("mk")_(upright("Motor"))\(upright("rep")_(upright("Tilt")) thick x\)$
is a well-typed `Tilt -> MotorAngle` in the empty environment, with no
declaration and no mapping; a motor angle can be manufactured from a
literal; and the crossing can hide inside a body whose signature
mentions no motor. Observation alone, with no construction, is safe but
cannot realize a mapping. The surviving model separates the two:

- a #strong[concept environment]
  $Theta : upright("SemanticId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("Ty")$
  binds each concept, write-once, to a representation that mentions no
  semantic type and contains no function type;
- $upright("rep") thick e$ is typed at $R$ whenever
  $e : upright("sem") thick s$ and
  $Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R$, everywhere;
- $upright("mk") thick s thick e$ is typed at $upright("sem") thick s$
  whenever $e : R$, $Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R$, #emph[and
  the grant permits $s$].

$ frac(Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R quad Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r e : upright("sem") thick s, Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r upright("rep") thick e : R) $

$ frac(G thick s quad Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R quad Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r e : R, Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r upright("mk") thick s thick e : upright("sem") thick s) $

The grant $G$ is a predicate on concepts. Client code is typed under the
empty grant. The realization of a declaration is typed under
$upright("Grant.of")\(tau\)$, the concepts in result position of its own
signature $tau$. A value of `MotorAngle` can therefore be constructed
only inside a declaration that announces `MotorAngle` in its signature,
which is exactly where a reader of the design would look for it. A
well-typed term constructs $s$ only where granted $s$\; the hidden
crossing above is rejected under the grant of an unrelated declaration
and becomes legal, and visible, once `tiltToMotor` is declared; binding
an unbound concept is monotone for typing, satisfaction, and global
well-formedness; and rebinding a concept to a different representation
is an edit that breaks existing realizations.

Two constraints on the representation were not anticipated.
Representation types must be free of semantic types, because if `Tilt`
may be represented #emph[by] `MotorAngle` then `rep` itself is a hidden
mapping under every policy, including observation-only. And they must be
data types, a requirement that arrived later from the reactive
semantics: a semantic value may be delayed, and a function-typed
representation would carry a closure across ticks.

The grant is a known shape --- a capability attached to a definition
site, or equivalently the private constructor of an abstract type
exported only to the module that declares it. What is specific here is
where the capability comes from: the signature the designer already
wrote, so no annotation is added. It is not presented as a capability
calculus. One consequence should be stated plainly. After all bodies are
inlined into one executable program, that program is checked under the
universal grant, because each construction was authorized at its own
declaration. Semantic isolation is a property of the design graph and
survives inlining as provenance, not as a type property of the
executable.

== Physical dimensions
<physical-dimensions>
Physical quantities have type $upright("q") thick d$ for a dimension
$d$, an exponent vector over a small set of base dimensions. There is no
dimension-specific typing rule; the algebra lives entirely in the types
of registered primitive operators,

$ upright("add")_d & : upright("q") thick d arrow.r upright("q") thick d arrow.r upright("q") thick d\,\
upright("mul")_(d_1 d_2) & : upright("q") thick d_1 arrow.r upright("q") thick d_2 arrow.r upright("q") thick\(d_1 + d_2\)\,\
upright("div")_(d_1 d_2) & : upright("q") thick d_1 arrow.r upright("q") thick d_2 arrow.r upright("q") thick\(d_1 - d_2\)\, $

and an application is checked by ordinary function application. Erasing
every dimension to the zero vector is sound and accepts `length + time`,
so the untyped numeric baseline is the erasure of dimensional typing in
the same sense that the representation baseline is the erasure of
nominal typing. Dimensions might instead have been validation metadata;
the argument against is that multiplication and division #emph[produce]
dimensions, so any checker recomputes the same inference, but that
family was argued against rather than excluded.

Dimension and semantic identity are orthogonal. `Tilt` and `MotorAngle`
both bound to `q Angle` remain distinct types. A mapping realized by the
dimensioned formula `λx. mk bright (rep x · gain)` with
`gain : q (0 − Angle)` is typed; a dimension error inside the formula is
caught by the same typing; and the formula cannot manufacture a
`MotorAngle` despite the shared dimension. The association between a
concept and its dimension lives in $Theta$, not in the identity and not
in the type constructor. The earlier draft's two-index
$upright("Sem")\[n\,d\]$ becomes $upright("sem") thick s$ together with
$Theta thick s = upright("some") thick\(upright("q") thick d\)$.

Units are surface (Part VI in full). A literal `n u` elaborates to a
dimensioned literal scaled by the unit's factor; changing the unit
changes the value, never the type, and mixed-unit addition works after
elaboration. Expressing a quantity in a unit --- its #emph[coordinate]
--- and building a quantity from a coordinate are the same arithmetic
against a unit constant: `inUnit(q, u)` is `q` divided by the unit's
scale and has dimension zero, `withUnit(x, u)` is `x` times the scale
and has the unit's dimension, and a conversion between two units is
their composition; each is elaborated, none is a kernel construct, and a
unit choice never reaches a type (`1 m` and `100 cm` are equal values of
one type). The unit laws --- round trips, derived conversion, dimension
safety --- are proved over an abstract scalar domain and instantiated by
a symbolic group in which `π` is a generator, so that a degree is
exactly `π/180` radian; the executable kernel truncates to naturals and
production approximates in floating point. A preferred display unit is
presentation: it changes the number shown and no judgment of the design.
Affine scales such as degrees Celsius are not linear (`0 °C` is
`273.15 K`), yet their literals and coordinates elaborate exactly by
adding an offset. Unit coordinates erase chart identity while preserving
affine coordinate change: the conversion between two charts is an affine
map, conversions compose and invert --- compatible charts are isomorphic
coordinate systems --- and differences inherit the linear part of that
transformation, so a difference of ten degrees Celsius is eighteen
degrees Fahrenheit from any base point, while a conversion with a
non-zero offset is not an additive homomorphism. The same abstraction
covers sensor calibration and encoder offsets. These laws are proved
over an abstract field and instantiated exactly at rationals; production
floating point is held to a toleranced version of them. Whether a sum of
two absolute temperatures should be permitted is a separate, optional
validation question that the dimension does not decide and conversion
does not need.

= Part V --- The Data and Equation Language
<part-v-the-data-and-equation-language>
The kernel of Parts III--IV computes with booleans, counts, quantities,
nominal concepts and optional values, and abstracts with lambdas over
them. That is enough to state the theorems about identity, refinement,
time and outputs, and it is not enough to write the equations designers
actually write: a brightness clamped to a range, a mode tested against a
finite set of modes, every sensor below a threshold, a pair of readings,
a calibration mapped over a collection. Phases 9b and 9c asked for the
smallest typed data/function basis that supports those equations without
turning BDL into a general functional language, and Phase 11 asked
whether the natural surface forms for them can be added with no semantic
change at all. This Part records the whole investigation: the
candidates, the counterexamples, the kernel additions, the definitional
library, the capability audit that reversed one of Phase 9b's own
decisions, and the surface forms.

== The question and the hypothesis
<the-question-and-the-hypothesis>
The design direction was stated before the experiments: a very small
core, parametric polymorphism, ordinary structured data, a rich
definitional standard library, and intent-oriented abstractions at the
UI. The hypothesis to test was a core of roughly `bool`, `nat`/`q d`,
`sem s`, `A → B`, `A × B`, `opt A`, `list A`, plus rank-1 polymorphism
--- with the instruction not to assume any proposed feature belongs in
the kernel.

The required cases were fixed in advance and every one is executed in
`BDL/Experiments/EquationExamples.lean`: (A) clamp a brightness; (B) a
mode in a finite set of modes; (C) every sensor below a temperature
threshold; (D) any fault above a severity threshold; (E) a pair of
temperature and humidity; (F) a calibration mapped over sensor values;
(G) two sampled collections zipped; (H) an optional fallback; (I)
dimension-preserving `min`\; (J) semantic-type-preserving generic
functions; (K) range membership; (L) a piecewise rule combining a range,
a collection predicate and a boolean; and (M), added when production's
`enum LampMode { Off, Automatic, Manual(Brightness) }` was inspected, an
enumeration with a payload.

== What entered the kernel, and why each item could not be derived
<what-entered-the-kernel-and-why-each-item-could-not-be-derived>
Four additions were made to the kernel; each was tested against a
derivation first.

#strong[Products.] `Ty.prod a b`, `Value.pair`, and the operators
`pair : a → b → a × b`, `fst`, `snd`. A pair is data exactly when both
components are (`Ty.prod_data`). The derivation that was tried and
rejected is the Church encoding. It fails twice. First, a Church pair is
an arrow, and arrows are not data: nothing of function type can be
delayed or transported (`arrow_not_delayable`, #strong[formally proved]
by inversion of the `delay` and `sync` typing rules, which require
`τ.Data`). Paired #emph[state] --- a delayed reading with its timestamp
--- therefore needs a data product. Second, a Church pair used as a
first-class value needs rank-2 types: in the toy System F of
`PolyAlternatives.lean`, the type of `fst` on Church pairs has rank 2
(`church_fst_rank`), and in the prenex fragment a pair instantiated at
one result type serves only one projection
(`church_pair_prenex_one_projection`). Products are value composition
only. They are never a component interface, an output bundle or a system
boundary --- Phase 8b's Counterexample 5 shows what a tuple-returning
declaration does to the dependency graph.

#strong[The list recursor.] `Expr.fold f z l`, with
`fold f z [x₁,…,xₙ] = f x₁ (… (f xₙ z))`, is a #emph[term former], not a
registered operator. The kernel has no recursion, deliberately; a total
language needs an eliminator for its inductive data, and this is the one
construct in BDL that applies a function value in the course of
evaluation. Registered operators still never apply closures. Its
evaluation rule unrolls syntactically through the environment:

$ frac(Delta\;I\;t\;rho tack.r f arrow.b.double v_f quad z arrow.b.double v_z quad l arrow.b.double\[thin\], upright("fold") thick f thick z thick l arrow.b.double v_z) #h(2em) frac(f arrow.b.double v_f quad z arrow.b.double v_z quad l arrow.b.double x : : x s quad\[x s\,v_z\,v_f\]tack.r upright("fold") thick\#2 thick\#1 thick\#0 arrow.b.double r quad\[r\,x\,v_f\]tack.r\#2 thin\#1 thin\#0 arrow.b.double v, upright("fold") thick f thick z thick l arrow.b.double v) $

The recursive premise evaluates the syntactic term
`fold (var 2) (var 1) (var 0)` in an environment holding the three
values; this keeps `Ev` an ordinary inductive relation with no mutual
recursion, so every earlier proof by induction on `Ev` extends by one
case. Totality is a separate lemma by induction on the list
(`fold_total`, `mfold_total`), and the fundamental theorem's `fold` case
uses it. Every collection operation --- `map`, `filter`, `any`, `all`,
`contains`, `append`, `sum`, `zip`, and, through `toList`, the option
eliminators --- is a definition over it (below). The alternative of one
primitive per operation was rejected because a primitive cannot apply a
closure and each would need its own evaluation rule; the alternative of
bounded unrolling was rejected because lists (the Phase-9a buffer) are
unbounded.

#strong[Equality at every data type.] `eq τ (h : τ.Data)`: structural
equality on data values --- booleans, numbers, `none`/`some`, pairs and
lists componentwise, semantic values by concept and representation ---
with the proof of `τ.Data` carried #emph[in the syntax]. This is the
kernel's only capability evidence: an equality on a function type is
unwritable rather than ill-typed, which keeps the `prim` typing rule
unconditional. Before Phase 9b, equality existed only at quantities, and
production encoded boolean equality as `(a ∧ b) ∨ (¬a ∧ ¬b)`. On
first-order values structural equality is equality (`Value.beq_iff`,
#strong[formally proved] by a mutual induction over the nested value
type).

#strong[Two first-order operators.] `drop τ` (the dual of `take`) and
`toList τ : opt τ → list τ`. The second is the one that matters: without
it an optional value has no eliminator that does not need a default ---
`getD` needs a fallback of the payload type, which a generic `mapOpt`
cannot produce --- and with it `fold` over a list of length at most one
is the option eliminator (`optElimF`, `mapOptF`). `drop` lets `zip` be
derived.

Every earlier theorem --- determinism, totality in one and many domains,
provenance, unfolding, the Phase-8 preservation results, the Phase-9a
buffer --- was re-established without change of statement. The logical
relation gained the product clause; the fundamental theorem gained the
`fold` case; the `Wiring` fragment gained a variant with variables for
the recursor's environment-passing sub-derivations (`Ev.noCloV`,
`Ev.foldCons_move`).

== Polymorphism: rank-1, by families, no kernel type variable
<polymorphism-rank-1-by-families-no-kernel-type-variable>
The five models compared, with the verdicts:

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33%),
    align: (auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([model], [verdict], [evidence],),
    table.hline(),
    [A --- monomorphic STLC kernel], [kept, unchanged], [typing rules
    unchanged; `HasType.unique`],
    [B --- per-type duplication], [what the kernel #emph[sees] after
    elaboration], [`instances_are_monomorphic`: three uses of `min` are
    three kernel terms],
    [C --- rank-1 parametric], [#strong[adopted, as definitional
    families]], [every library entry is `Ty → Expr` (or `Dim → Expr`);
    `*_typed` proves its scheme at every instance],
    [D --- System F (`Λ`, `[τ]`, `∀`)], [rejected], [the toy `FTy` with
    `rank` measures what it would add; its prenex fragment #emph[is]
    instantiation of families],
    [E --- higher rank], [rejected], [every candidate use has rank ≥ 2
    (`applyBoth_rank`, `existential_rank`) and a rank-1 replacement
    (`applyBoth_replacement`)],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Why C needs no kernel support: a use site always has #emph[closed]
argument types. Every declaration's expected type is frozen and closed
since Phase 1, and `infer` is bottom-up, so finding the instance of a
scheme is one-way #emph[matching] of the scheme's pattern against closed
types --- decidable, returning the unique substitution on the pattern's
variables (`matchTy_sound`, `matchTy_complete`, #strong[formally proved]
in `Surface/Poly.lean`). There is no unification of two open types, no
let-generalization inside expressions, and no principal-type search:
those problems arise when a definition's type is inferred from its body,
and BDL definitions carry their signature (mappings do; a helper `fn`
would). Dimension polymorphism (`sum : list (q d) → q d`, `min` at
`q d`) uses the same mechanism with dimension pattern variables; no kind
system, no `Type + Dim` universe, because the dimension algebra already
lives in the primitive table.

The scheme model: `PTy` is the kernel's type formers over type variables
and dimension patterns (`PDim.const d | PDim.dvar n`); `Subst` maps both
kinds of variable; `Scheme = ⟨pattern, caps⟩` where
`caps : List (Nat × Cap)` names, per variable, what it needs;
`Scheme.instantiate O Θ τ` matches then checks the capabilities and is
sound (`Scheme.instantiate_sound`). The two failure points have
designer-level explanations --- #emph[no instance] ("expected a
collection") and #emph[capability failed] ("cannot compare functions"\;
"Mode values can be compared for equality, but they have no default
order") --- and a nominal mismatch is reported by the kernel's unique
typing as "Brightness and Opacity are different concepts", never as a
unification residue, because there is no unification.

== Capabilities: the audit that reverted a decision
<capabilities-the-audit-that-reverted-a-decision>
Phase 9b's first form generalized both `eq` and `lt` to every data type
through a structural order on values: booleans `false < true`, numbers,
`none < some`, pairs and lists lexicographically, concepts by
representation. It was formally consistent --- `Red_prim` held,
determinism held --- and the closed capability vocabulary collapsed to
`{Data}`. Phase 9c audited it and rejected it.

The audit asked, for each type, whether `==` and `<` have a
domain-natural meaning for a behavior designer:

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33%),
    align: (auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([expression], [meaning], [verdict],),
    table.hline(),
    [`temperature1 == temperature2`, `<`], [magnitude comparison of one
    quantity], [Eq, Ord (`q d`\; `q Length < q Time` still rejected)],
    [`brightness1 < brightness2`], [the concept is a magnitude the
    designer declared ordered], [Ord #emph[by declaration], through the
    representation],
    [`mode1 == mode2`], [same mode], [Eq],
    [`mode1 < mode2`], [none --- any order would come from a code, a
    constructor tag or a `SemanticId`], [rejected],
    [`pair1 == pair2`], [same reading], [Eq],
    [`pair1 < pair2`], [lexicographic order is a mathematical
    convenience with no design meaning], [rejected],
    [`list1 == list2`], [same collection in the same order], [Eq],
    [`list1 < list2`], [none], [rejected],
    [`optional1 == optional2`], [both absent, or both present and
    equal], [Eq],
    [`None < Some x`], [a constructor-tag artifact], [rejected],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

So `Data ⇒ Eq` holds (extensionally on this type grammar:
`Cap.eq_iff_data`), but `Eq ⇏ Ord`. An implementation may need a total
order on values for maps, canonical forms, serialization and tests; that
is toolchain-internal and is not `<` in BDL. The kernel's structural
order (`Value.blt`) was deleted and `lt` restored to `lt (d : Dim)` on
quantities --- the Phase-4 form --- which made Phase 9b #emph[smaller].
The surface vocabulary became `Cap = data | eq | ord` (`Poly.Cap`):
`data` is what `delay`/`sync` need and what the `eq` proof field checks;
`eq` coincides with `data` today and is kept as a separate name because
it answers a different question and is what diagnostics say; `ord` is a
#emph[surface] capability --- a quantity, or a concept the designer
declared ordered (`OrdDecl`) and represented by a quantity (`Ty.ordB`)
--- with no kernel counterpart, because an ordered concept compares as
`lt d` on `rep`, a term the kernel already admits. Enumerations follow
the same rule: equality is natural, declaration order is never silently
behavioral order.

Ordering in the library is evidence-indexed: `Ordered τ` is `q d`, or
`sem s d` for a concept declared ordered with representation `q d`
(well-formed against Θ: `Ordered.WF`); `ltAt o a b` is `lt d a b` on a
quantity and `lt d (rep a) (rep b)` on a concept, so `min`, `max`,
`clamp`, `inRange`, `inInterval` return one of their arguments with
identity intact. The comparator escape hatch `minBy`/`maxBy` needs no
declaration and loses nothing: `minBy_recovers_min` (#strong[formally
proved]) shows the comparator `λa b. a < b` makes `minBy` compute
exactly `min`. Negative examples on realistic concepts:
`mode1 == mode2`, `pair == pair`, `list == list`, `opt == opt` accepted;
`mode < mode`, `pair < pair`, `list < list`, `None < Some`,
`bool < bool` rejected at the surface (`lt_rejected`,
`min_mode_rejected`) and unwritable in the kernel
(`lt_only_on_quantities`).

Production adopted this as ADR-0025 and refined it as ADR-0026: two
values of one concept compare as that concept (`==` always, `<` and the
ordered equations only while the concept is declared ordered); two
values of different concepts never compare, whatever their
representations; a concept beside a #emph[plain value of its
representation] --- `tilt < 10 deg` --- is observed and compared as that
representation, because the designer wrote a number. The remaining
asymmetry is visible and intended: `min(o1, o2)` is refused while
`min(o1, 0.5)` is not, and Explain shows the observation.

== The definitional library
<the-definitional-library>
`Surface/Stdlib.lean` is the reference for production's `bdl-equations`.
Each entry is a closed de Bruijn term indexed by types: `idF τ`,
`constF τ σ`, `swapF a b`, `minF o`, `maxF o`, `clampF o`, `inRangeF o`,
`inIntervalF o`, `minByF τ`, `maxByF τ`, `foldrF τ σ`, `anyF τ`,
`allF τ`, `containsF τ h`, `mapF τ σ`, `filterF τ`, `appendF τ`,
`sumF d`, `optElimF τ σ`, `mapOptF τ σ`, `getOrElseF τ`, `zipF a b`\;
`listLit`, `oneOfE` (a finite-set literal is `contains` over a list
literal); records as right-nested pairs with positional projections
(`recTy`, `recE`, `projE`). `zip` is derived through `fold`, `take 1`,
`drop 1` and `reverse`, folding over the reversed first list with the
remaining second list and the accumulated pairs in a pair --- not
pretty, and the point is that it is derivable.

Every entry is a #strong[combinator]: variables, literals, lambdas,
applications, registered operators, the recursor and, since 9c, `rep`
--- no reference, no state, no transport, no `mk`. For combinators,
proved once: typing is independent of the design and the grant and reads
Θ only through write-once representation bindings
(`HasType.comb_irrelevant`); the value is the same in every design at
every tick under every input (`lib_eval_context_free`, from the kernel
lemma `Ev.pure`: a pure term in a pure environment is context-free); the
term is clocked in every domain (`lib_clocked`); nothing is constructed
(`Comb.noConstruct`); and the four together as the inlining statement
`lib_expansion`. This is what lets production inline an equation at each
use without creating a declaration --- a library entry as a declaration
would be monomorphic and would enter the dependency graph (FVD-0094).

The evaluation specifications connect each entry to the mathematical
function: `any_spec` (`List.any`), `all_spec`, `contains_spec`
(`List.any (beq x)`), `map_spec`, `filter_spec`, `min_spec`, `max_spec`,
`clamp_spec`, `inRange_spec` (by the compared magnitudes `Ordered.key`),
each #strong[formally proved] through a general `fold_spec`: the
recursor computes `List.foldr g` whenever the step closure implements
`g` on the reachable accumulators. From these, finite quantification is
a fold: `forall_in_list` (`∀ x ∈ xs, P x` iff `all xs P` evaluates to
`true`) and `exists_in_list`\; a finite-set literal means membership
(`oneOf_mem`, via `beq_iff`), and duplicates do not change the answer
(`oneOf_dup_irrelevant`), so no uniqueness convention and no `Set` type.
An interval is a pair with a convention and membership is a function of
the pair. A predicate is an ordinary `α → bool`.

Nominality survives all of it: `generic_preserves_identity` ---
#emph[any] family typed at `α → α → α`, instantiated at concept `s`,
rejects an argument of concept `s' ≠ s`, the representations never
consulted; `generic_preserves_dimension` for `q d` vs `q d'`\;
`pair_projections_keep_concepts`\; `map_keeps_concepts`\;
`eq_across_concepts_rejected`. Executed: `min` at Brightness typed and
Opacity rejected though both are `q 0` underneath (`exJ`), and the same
for lengths and times (`exI`).

== Enumerations, records, sets: what was encoded and what was deferred
<enumerations-records-sets-what-was-encoded-and-what-was-deferred>
Production's textual syntax declares enumerations with payloads and
matches on them. Phase 9b encoded `LampMode` as a tag paired with an
optional payload, with `match` as conditionals on the tag (`exM`,
executed), and deferred a kernel sum type: nothing tested needs more
than the encoding gives, and the cost of a kernel `sum` would be one
more eliminator term former, exactly like `fold`. Production keeps user
enums open (ISS-0005). Records are positional nested pairs; labels
resolve to positions at elaboration; row polymorphism was rejected
because no case needs a function generic over record shapes. Sets are
list literals with `contains`\; set algebra is list definitions when
needed; nothing tested observes a canonical form.

== The expressiveness ceiling
<the-expressiveness-ceiling>
Total, first-order-data computation over booleans, quantities, nominal
concepts, options, lists and pairs, with higher-order functions and one
list recursor; generic definitions instantiated at closed types; no
general recursion, no type abstraction in terms, no sums yet (encoded),
no unbounded quantification. This is a design recommendation backed by
the executed cases and the proved library, minimal among the tested
candidates; it is not a minimality theorem. The seven questions the
phase was asked have the answers: rank-1 by families constrained by
`{Data, Eq, Ord}` is the weakest useful polymorphism; products belong in
the data core; no `Set` type; finite `∀`/`∃` reduce to folds, proved; no
existentials (Phase 8a components hide by fresh instantiation); no user
typeclasses; and the ceiling above.

== The natural expression surface (Phase 11)
<the-natural-expression-surface-phase-11>
Designers should be able to write

```
all reading in readings:
    reading in 10 deg .. 45 deg
```

while the semantics stays exactly the verified Phase-9 machinery. Phase
11 tested that binder syntax and closed ranges are #emph[conservative]
surface abstractions and proved it for a six-form fragment
(`Surface/Natural.lean`). The surface model `NatExpr` has an embedded
closed core term, a named binder local, application, the four binders
`all/any/map/filter x in xs: body` with the element type chosen by local
inference, a range `x in lo .. hi` with its `Ordered` evidence, and a
coalesce `x ?? d`. Elaboration `desugar` is one-way, under a binder
stack:

```
all x in xs: p    ↦  app2 (allF τ) (lam τ p') xs'        (any, map, filter alike)
x in lo .. hi     ↦  app3 (inRangeF o) x' lo' hi'
x ?? d            ↦  app2 (getOrElseF τ) x' d'
```

A binder local #emph[is] the kernel's lambda parameter: `desugar`
resolves a name to its de Bruijn index --- nearest binder first --- and
adds nothing. #strong[Formally proved]: nearest-binder scoping,
shadowing, an unbound name is an error rather than a free variable,
ambient references are untouched (`desugar_local_nearest`,
`desugar_shadow`, `desugar_unbound`, `desugar_core`); alpha-equivalence
--- renaming a binder and its occurrences to a name fresh in the
expression and the stack leaves the elaboration unchanged
(`desugar_rename`, `alpha`), which is what a Formula Composer generating
fresh locals needs; no `mk` is introduced (`desugar_constructs`); typing
of each form with the local #emph[forced] to the collection's element
type by inversion (`binder_local_type`) and range bounds forced to the
value's nominal type (`range_bounds_forced`); evaluation exactly the
library's (`binder_all_eval`, … from `all_spec`, `any_spec`, `map_spec`,
`filter_spec`\; `natural_forall`, `natural_exists`\; `range_eval` =
`lo ≤ x ∧ x ≤ hi`); and clocks of the elaborated term are the operands'
(`binder_clock`, `range_clock`).

Executed: the call form and the natural form elaborate to literally the
same term; `angle in 10 deg .. 45 deg` after unit elaboration, with the
boundary values checked; nested `all row in rows: any v in row: v > 0`\;
shadowing where the inner `x` ranges over `ys`\; alpha renaming under
shadowing; `Tilt` ranges with `Tilt` bounds accepted, `q Angle` bounds
rejected, and accepted through `rep`\; a `MotorAngle` predicate rejected
on a `Tilt` local; the required negatives (`all x in 5: true`,
`filter x in xs: 5`, `angle in 2 s .. 3 s`, an unordered concept in a
range, a binder variable outside its body). Verdicts: binders,
`BinderKind`, the range node and `??` are surface desugaring; an
interval type, general comprehension (generators, `yield`, `where`) and
a general quantifier are removed --- nested binders cover every required
case, and the forms are finite list equations.

Production implements the forms (P11; ADR-0028's second amendment;
#strong[production implemented and tested]): `bdl-elab::formula::binder`
lowers the three forms once to the equation library, the parser keeps
them as their own nodes and the formatter keeps the spelling authored,
binder locals are lexically scoped to the body, and the tests
`natural_forms_lower_to_the_same_core_as_the_call_forms`,
`binder_locals_are_elements_scoped_to_the_body` and
`natural_form_mistakes_are_named_in_their_own_words` discharge the
Phase-11 claims by differential elaboration; the Composer draws binders
and ranges with local chips and `??` as a comparison node
(`ComposeAction.binder`, `range`). The production recommendations
recorded with the phase, which the implementation followed: `all`,
`any`, `map`, `filter` and `in` as contextual keywords only in the
binder head, so existing names keep parsing; the local visible in the
body only; the natural form kept as authored and never reconstructed
from Core; `..` binding tighter than `in` and looser than arithmetic,
legal only as the right operand of `in`\; local inference exactly
`binder_local_type`\; the Composer representing a binder as a node with
a fresh local backed by `desugar_rename`\; diagnostics in concept
language ("`5` is not a collection", "Mode values have no order, so
`in lo .. hi` does not apply").

= Part VI --- Units, Coordinates and Charts
<part-vi-units-coordinates-and-charts>
Dimensions entered the kernel in Phase 3 (Part IV): a quantity `q d`
carries an exponent vector, the dimension algebra lives in the types of
the primitive operators (`mul : q d₁ → q d₂ → q (d₁ + d₂)`), and
dimensional typing rejects `length + time` where the erased numeric
baseline accepts it. Units were surface from the start (FVD-0032): a
literal `n u` elaborates to a scaled dimensioned literal; changing the
unit changes the value, never the type. Phase 10 asked what more the
same quantity in different units needs --- extracting a coordinate,
constructing from a coordinate, letting an editor infer dimensions for
incomplete expressions, keeping units out of type identity --- and Phase
10b revisited the one conclusion of Phase 10 that turned out to be too
strong. This Part records both, the production realization, and the
design decision about who owns a unit in the authoring surface.

== Three notions kept apart
<three-notions-kept-apart>
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33%),
    align: (auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([notion], [formal object], [layer],),
    table.hline(),
    [physical quantity], [a kernel value of type `q d`: a canonical
    magnitude and a dimension], [kernel],
    [unit coordinate], [`inUnit q u = q / scale(u)`, a dimensionless
    number], [surface elaboration],
    [display / authoring
    unit], [`Presentation.preferred : SemanticId → Option Unit`], [presentation],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Collapsing any two of these is the mistake the phase was designed to
avoid: a quantity with a unit inside it splits one quantity into many
types; a coordinate that remembers its unit is a runtime tag nobody
needs; a display preference that enters elaboration changes semantics
when a designer changes what they like to see.

== Linear units: no kernel construct
<linear-units-no-kernel-construct>
Six models were compared. Literal-only elaboration (A) is insufficient
alone --- a coordinate is needed for display, for normalization (`tilt`
in degrees ÷ 90), and for export. `inUnit(q, u) : Scalar` by elaboration
(B) and `withUnit(x, u) : Q[d]` by elaboration (C) were adopted:
`inUnit` is `div q (lit d scale(u))`, typed `q (d − d) = q 0`
(`inUnitE_typed`) and rejecting a quantity of another dimension by
inversion (`inUnitE_safe`); `withUnit` is `mul x (lit d scale(u))`,
typed `q (0 + d)` (`withUnitE_typed`) and never a concept
(`withUnitE_is_quantity`); a literal is `withUnit`. First-class runtime
units (D) were rejected --- no tested case delays, syncs, stores or
compares a unit, and a UI dropdown is not a runtime value. Units in
quantity types (E) were rejected --- `1 m` and `100 cm` would differ in
type while being one quantity (`exA`: same type, equal values). A kernel
conversion primitive (F) was rejected ---
`convert x u v = inUnit (withUnit x u) v = x·scale(u)/scale(v)`
(`convert_eq`, `ev_convertE`), transitive (`convert_trans`), identity on
the same unit (`convert_self`), mismatch rejected never coerced
(`inUnit_mismatch`). Unit operations construct nothing
(`unitOps_no_construction`), and on a concept they go through `rep` ---
so `inUnit(TiltValue, deg)` obeys the representation discipline, and
rebuilding a concept from a coordinate requires `mk` under the concept's
grant. Tilt and MotorAngle are both readable in degrees and stay
distinct under every unit round trip (`nominal_distinct`); Brightness
and Opacity likewise. Unit compatibility is not identity.

== The numeric domain, in the open
<the-numeric-domain-in-the-open>
The formal development says exactly where exactness holds. Unit laws are
proved over an abstract scalar domain `Scalars K` --- a commutative
monoid with a division that cancels multiplication by a non-zero scale
--- and instantiated by `Sym`, the free abelian group on the generators
`2, 3, 5, 127, π`. Every registered scale is an element, exactly:
`deg = π/180 rad = π·2⁻²·3⁻²·5⁻¹`, `inch = 127/5000 m`. Round trips
(`inUnit_withUnit`, `withUnit_inUnit`), conversion and mismatch hold
with π symbolic: `90 deg` in radians is `π/2` (`exD`), not 1.5707…. The
executable kernel's magnitudes are naturals, so its registry uses
integer scales relative to canonical sub-units --- `0.1 mm`, `ms`,
arc-second, `g`, `K/180` --- under which mm, cm, m, km, inch, deg, turn,
ms, s, min, g, kg and K are exact; round trip 1 is exact for every
positive scale (`inUnit_withUnit_nat`) and round trip 2 exact when the
scale divides the magnitude (`withUnit_inUnit_nat`), the strongest law
integer division admits; radians are #emph[not] in that registry because
their scale is not an integer in any degree-compatible basis. Production
uses IEEE doubles with radians canonical (ADR-0011; `bdl-elab::units`):
neither round trip holds exactly there, and the document says so rather
than hiding it (Part XIII).

A unit itself is `⟨id, dim, scale⟩` in a registry; its symbol is not
part of it --- two units with equal identity are the same unit whatever
they are spelled --- and `unitsFor reg d` is sound and complete relative
to the registry (`unitsFor_sound`, `unitsFor_complete`).

== Presentation, and the realistic formula
<presentation-and-the-realistic-formula>
`Presentation` is a separate object; a design with a presentation is a
pair, and every kernel judgment of the pair --- typing, evaluation,
dependencies, clocks --- is literally the judgment of the design
(`presentation_irrelevant_*`, by construction, `rfl`); what changes is
the displayed number (`presentation_changes_display`). Ordering compares
canonical magnitudes through `ltAt`, which mentions no unit; comparing
#emph[displayed] coordinates would not be safe, since integer display
can identify distinct magnitudes (`display_may_identify_distinct`).

The recurring formula `Tilt → Brightness`: `tilt / (90 deg)` and
`inUnit(tilt, deg) / 90` are both dimensionless and evaluate equal for
every tilt (`normalizations_agree`, `exF`). The representation-aware
form is the second --- it names the unit the designer thinks in and
keeps the divisor a plain number --- and neither changes the concept:
both consume `rep tilt`, and the result is wrapped as Brightness by the
block's own signature (ADR-0013).

Design guidance, not a theorem, for persistence: the #emph[source
literal unit] (`90 deg`) is semantic source --- its scale enters
elaboration --- and lives in the formula text; the #emph[concept
preferred display unit] (`Tilt shown as deg`) is authoring metadata
beside the display name and never enters elaboration; a
#emph[simulation-input display unit] is session state.

== Unit ownership in authoring
<unit-ownership-in-authoring>
The production Formula Composer made this a rule (ADR-0028): in
`tilt / 90 deg`, `tilt` is a semantic reference and `90 deg` is a
designer-authored quantity literal. #strong[A literal owns an editable
unit; a semantic reference does not; a display boundary may carry a
presentation unit.] The reason is semantic ownership. A literal's unit
is part of what the designer #emph[wrote] --- its scale enters
elaboration, so switching it with the quantity kept (`180 deg` →
`3.141592653589793 rad`) is a change of spelling that preserves meaning,
and editing the coordinate is a change of meaning; both are the
designer's to make on the literal. A reference's kind is its
declaration's: `tilt` is a `Tilt`, represented as an angle, and no unit
is part of that; offering a unit pop-up on a reference would invite a
rewrite of the representation binding of a concept from inside one
formula, which is exactly the representation escape hatch the grant
discipline forbids. The display of a reference's #emph[value] --- in
simulation, in the inspector --- may use the concept's preferred unit,
which is presentation. This decision is traceable to
`unitOps_no_construction`, `withUnitE_is_quantity` and
`presentation_irrelevant_*`, not to taste: the Composer draws a literal
as two fields (coordinate and unit pop-up) and a reference as a chip
with its concept's socket glyph, because those are the two semantic
situations.

== Affine units: the failure of scale-only units, and the revision
<affine-units-the-failure-of-scale-only-units-and-the-revision>
Temperature scales are affine: `canonical = scale·x + offset`. Phase 10
showed, executably, that the linear model cannot represent °C or °F ---
`0 °C = 273.15 K`, which no scale produces from 0 (`celsius_not_linear`)
--- and that an affine #emph[literal] and an affine #emph[coordinate]
nevertheless elaborate exactly with no kernel change:
`n °C ↦ lit Temp (n·s + off)`, `inUnit°C q ↦ (q − off)/s`, in the
`K/180` basis where °C and °F have integer scales and offsets
(`affLitE_typed`, `affInUnitE_typed`, `affine_roundtrip_ev`\;
`0 °C = 32 °F`, `100 °C = 212 °F` in `scales_agree`). What breaks is
arithmetic on #emph[absolute] values: `20 °C − 10 °C` is a difference of
`10 K` (`delta_is_linear`), while `10 °C + 10 °C` is well typed at
`q Temp` and reads `293 °C` (`sum_of_points_is_not_a_point`,
`sum_well_typed`). The kernel's dimension cannot separate a point on the
scale from a difference.

#strong[Phase 10's conclusion], as first recorded: the missing
information is a #emph[sort] --- point or difference --- on top of the
dimension (`AffSort`, with `affAdd`/`affSub` as the affine-space rules:
`point + point` refused, `point − point = delta`), and a Formula
Composer cannot offer only difference units for a delta slot from the
dimension alone (`delta_candidates_need_sort`). Affine conversion was
called "safe now"\; affine #emph[arithmetic safety] was said to need the
sort and was deferred, with the sort treated as potentially necessary
for future production.

#strong[Phase 10b tested the smaller hypothesis] that for
#emph[conversion] chart-specific information is intentionally erased at
coordinatization and only the affine transformation structure between
coordinate systems must be preserved. It holds, and the conclusion was
revised. This revision is recorded as research evidence, not smoothed
over.

== Charts: coordinate erasure and conversion functoriality (Phase 10b)
<charts-coordinate-erasure-and-conversion-functoriality-phase-10b>
Over one physical dimension, a chart is `⟨scale, offset⟩`, valid when
`scale ≠ 0`, with

$ upright("reconstruct")_u\(x\)= s_u thin x + o_u\,#h(2em) upright("coord")_u\(q\)=\(q - o_u\)\/s_u . $

The scalar domain is an abstract field (`Field K`: commutative, with
inverses of non-zero elements, negatives and fractions) instantiated by
`Q`, exact rationals built in the development as a quotient of `Int`
fractions with every law proved from `Int`'s ring identities --- because
core Lean's `Rat` proves its algebra with `Classical.choice`, which this
development has kept out of every proof. Concrete equalities are decided
by cross-multiplication.

Compatible charts form a groupoid of affine isomorphisms (theorem-level;
no category-theory framework was built). Unit coordinates erase chart
identity while preserving affine coordinate change; differences inherit
the linear part of that transformation. A conversion with a non-zero
offset is #emph[not] an additive homomorphism, and this document never
calls Celsius-to-Fahrenheit one.

#strong[Celsius and Fahrenheit, exactly.] Kelvin canonical,
`celsius = ⟨1, 27315/100⟩`, `fahrenheit = ⟨5/9, 45967/180⟩`:
`C(°C,°F)(x) = 9/5·x + 32` and `C(°F,°C)(x) = 5/9·(x − 32)` for every
`x` (`CtoF_closed`, `FtoC_closed`); `0 °C = 32 °F`, `100 °C = 212 °F`,
`−40 °C = −40 °F`, the °C→°F→°C round trip, °C→K→°F equal to °C→°F,
`Δ10 °C = Δ18 °F` from two base points, `Δ°C = 5/9·Δ°F`, and the
non-additivity counterexample `f(0+0) = 32 ≠ 64` (executed,
`Experiments/AffineExamples.lean`).

#strong[Not a Celsius special case.] A 10-bit ADC over 5 V, millivolts,
and a calibrated reading with a 0.5 V zero instantiate the same theorems
--- composition through millivolts, inverse back to raw, a difference
independent of base (`exH`); so does an encoder with home offset,
`angle = 45/512·count + 30°` (`exI`). Unit conversion and sensor
calibration are one affine-map abstraction.

#strong[The scalar coordinate is chartless.] `32` is a Fahrenheit
coordinate of `0 °C` and a Celsius coordinate of `32 °C`
(`coordinate_needs_chart`); the destination chart supplied to
`reconstruct`/`convert` interprets it; no runtime tag is needed, and no
theorem requires a unit to be data, delayed, synced, stored or compared
--- Phase 10's rejection of runtime units re-audited and confirmed.

#strong[AffSort, revised.] Conversion never takes a sort and the sort
checker never takes a chart (`sort_orthogonal_to_conversion`,
`conversion_orthogonal_to_sort`, by construction). Two claims coexist:
(A) unit conversion is complete and correct without point/delta; (B) a
domain-specific checker may still use point/delta to reject
`point + point`, as #emph[optional physical-arithmetic validation],
orthogonal to A. The design decision FVD-0106 was rewritten from "affine
conversion works, but point/delta is missing information" to "affine
conversion is complete as coordinate-change semantics; point/delta is
additional validation information for restricting physical arithmetic."
`Ty.q d` is unchanged; no conversion theorem needed a sort in the type.

== The production chart model
<the-production-chart-model>
Production (`crates/bdl-elab/src/units.rs`, ADR-0028 and its amendment)
realizes the registry as `UnitDef { id, symbol, dim, chart }` with

```rust
pub enum Chart {
    Linear { factor: f64 },              // canonical = coordinate × factor
    Affine { scale: f64, offset: f64 },  // canonical = coordinate × scale + offset, scale ≠ 0
}
```

and `coord`, `reconstruct`, `linear_part` on the chart;
`convert(x, from, to) = coord_to(reconstruct_from(x))` is the one
conversion operation and hides the chart's shape. The Phase-10b laws are
property-tested on `f64` --- identity, composition, inverse, display
switch preserving the quantity, the difference map linear --- within a
few ulps, including the Celsius/Fahrenheit charts; the formal laws are
exact. The affine charts exist as tested infrastructure and are
#strong[not] in the registry offered to formulas or the Composer's
pickers (ISS-0004): conversion and display of an absolute temperature
are safe, arithmetic on absolute temperatures is a separate validation
concern, and the product does not offer `20 °C` in a formula until the
point/difference validation exists or a decision is taken not to need
it. The symbol is presentation; identity is the id; `inch` is spelled
out because `in` is the membership keyword.

The production contract for floating point, as recommended by the formal
phase: for registered charts `u, v, w` and sampled `x`,
`|C(u,u)(x) − x| ≤ ε|x|`, `|C(v,w)(C(u,v)(x)) − C(u,w)(x)| ≤ ε|x|`,
`|C(v,u)(C(u,v)(x)) − x| ≤ ε|x|`,
`|(C(u,v)(x+δ) − C(u,v)(x)) − L(u,v)δ| ≤ ε|δ|`, and
`|reconstruct_v(C(u,v)(coord_u(q))) − q| ≤ ε|q|`, with `ε` a few ulps
scaled by the largest coefficient, plus exact-rational oracles --- never
a claim of exact `f64` identity or composition.

== The Formula Composer's formal basis
<the-formula-composers-formal-basis>
A structured composer needs, from the formal side, exactly three things:
typed holes, expected-dimension propagation, and candidate-unit
inference. `Surface/Composer.lean` gives them and no more.

`PExpr` is holes, known operands by dimension (a literal, a reference or
a known equation result), and `add/sub/mul/div`\; it is never executed.
`check` is bottom-up on the known parts. `solve` pushes an expected
dimension down by the local rules of each operator in the `Dim` group
--- `add/sub`: both sides get the result; `mul`: the other side gets
`r − d`\; `div`: numerator `r + d`, denominator `d − r` ---
deterministically and in one pass; a product of two holes is reported
#emph[unsolved], never searched. #strong[Formally proved] for the whole
fragment: `solve_sound` (filling the holes as solved makes the
expression check at the expected dimension) and `solve_complete` (any
filling that checks agrees with the solution --- a one-hole equation in
an abelian group has one solution); `candidates_sound`,
`candidates_complete` and `slot_sound` (the units offered for a hole are
exactly the registered units of its solved dimension);
`refCandidates_sound` for declaration references. Executed:
`? / (1 s) : Speed ⇒ ? : Length` with candidates mm, cm, m, km, inch
(`exG`); `Force × ? : Torque ⇒ ? : Length` (`exH`); the explanation
`Speed = [Length] / [Time]` as slots (`speed_slot`). No unification, no
symbolic algebra beyond the group laws.

The Composer does not need to make a unit part of an expression's type:
an affine quantity literal needs the physical dimension, the chosen
chart and the scalar coordinate, and changing the displayed chart is
`coord_u(q) → coord_v(q)` with `q` preserved. What it #emph[would] need
beyond the dimension to offer only difference units for a delta slot is
the point/difference sort --- which is why that sort is recorded as
optional validation information the editor could carry, not as anything
in the kernel.

= Part VII --- Reactive Semantics
<part-vii-reactive-semantics>
== A Minimal Reactive Semantics
<a-minimal-reactive-semantics>
=== One primitive
<one-primitive>
The reactive kernel adds one expression form and no types:

$ upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e . $

Its meaning is given by a tick-indexed big-step evaluation relation
$upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick t thick rho thick e thick v$:
the value of $e$ at tick $t$ under a local environment $rho$, where
$I : upright("DeclId") arrow.r bb(N) arrow.r upright("Value")$ supplies
the inputs. Every declaration is a stream by interpretation. An
unresolved declaration is an input and takes its value from $I$\; a
realized declaration is evaluated from its body at the current tick;
$upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e$ evaluates $e$ at tick
$t$ when read at tick $t + 1$, and $italic(i n i t)$ at tick $0$:

$ frac(Delta^(upright(r e a l))\(d\)= upright("none"), upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick t thick rho thick\(upright("declRef") thick d\)thick\(I thick d thick t\)) $

$ frac(upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick 0 thick rho thick italic(i n i t) thick v, upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick 0 thick rho thick\(upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) #h(2em) frac(upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick t thick rho thick e thick v, upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick\(t + 1\)thick rho thick\(upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) . $

There is no signal type in $upright("Ty")$. Under this semantics a
signal type would be inhabited by exactly the terms of the underlying
type and would reject nothing. The information a reactive type would
carry in a multi-domain setting is #emph[which clock], and the next
section places that information in a judgment rather than a type. There
is likewise no event type. Within one domain an input delivers at most
one value per tick by construction, so an occurrence is a stream of
optional type, and the streams of type $upright("opt") thick tau$ are
exactly the streams of multiplicity at most one. What separates an
occurrence from an optional value --- two occurrences falling in one
observation interval --- can only be seen when a source ticks faster
than its observer. That is a cross-domain question and is treated at the
end of this part.

Two restrictions on $upright("delay")$ were forced by the totality proof
rather than chosen. The delayed type must be a #strong[data] type, one
with no function type inside, because a delayed closure would have to
persist across ticks and the logical relation for closures is
tick-indexed and cannot be transported. And $upright("delay")$ may occur
only at #strong[top level], under no binder, because a delay under a
lambda would re-evaluate its operand at the previous tick in an
environment created at the current tick. Temporal state therefore
belongs to declarations, and mappings are pointwise. This is the
arrangement of `pre` in Lustre, where it lives in nodes rather than in
functions @halbwachs1991lustre, and its practical consequence is that a
reusable stateful component is instantiated into fresh declarations
rather than abstracted over.

=== Causality
<causality>
The dependency graph on declarations comes in three variants. Structural
dependency, $upright("DependsOn")$, records every reference in a body.
Instantaneous dependency, $upright("InstDependsOn")$, excludes
references under the delayed operand of a $upright("delay")$ (the
initial value is read at tick $0$ and counts as instantaneous). A design
is #strong[causal] when its instantaneous graph is acyclic, witnessed by
a bounded rank:

$ upright("Causal") thick Delta thick := thick exists thin italic(r a n k)\,R . thick & \(forall d . thick italic(r a n k) thick d < R\)thick and\
forall a thin b . thick & upright("InstDependsOn") thick Delta thick a thick b arrow.r italic(r a n k) thick b < italic(r a n k) thick a . $

On the delay-free fragment this coincides with structural acyclicity, so
the earlier acyclicity condition is the timeless special case rather
than a replaced requirement. A structural cycle every one of whose paths
passes through a delayed operand --- `A := delay 0 B; B := A`, or a
self-delayed accumulator --- is causal and runs at every tick. A cycle
that is partly delayed is not causal. A strict cycle, one through
neither a delay nor a lambda, has no value at any tick.

Evaluation is a partial function: one tick, one environment, one term,
at most one value, with no hidden evaluation order, and this holds
unconditionally. It is total on causal designs: if $Delta$ is causal and
globally well formed and the inputs are well typed, every declaration
has a value at every tick, related to its type by a logical relation, by
an induction on tick, rank, and derivation. An executable interpreter is
proved sound for the relation, and every trace reported in Parts III--X
was obtained by running it.

One gap should be recorded. A cycle guarded by a lambda, `A := λx. A x`,
is rejected by $upright("Causal")$, yet `declRef A` does evaluate --- to
a closure; only applying it diverges. $upright("Causal")$ is
conservative for lambda-guarded cycles, and the negative theorem covers
strict cycles only.

=== Derived operators
<derived-operators>
Every temporal operator of the surface language reduces to
$upright("delay")$ and the primitive operators. There is no independent
kernel definition of `count` for the reduction to be proved equivalent
to; what was done instead was to elaborate each operator, check its
typing and causality, and run it on a concrete input trace. In each row
the declaration refers to itself. Each is a self-delayed cycle, the
class that structural acyclicity forbade and causality licenses.

#block(width: 100%)[
#set text(size: 8pt)
#table(
  columns: (0.9fr, 1.6fr), align: left, inset: (x: 3pt, y: 2.6pt),
  stroke: (x: none, y: 0.3pt),
  table.header([*Surface*], [*Declaration shape*]),
  [`previous x`], [`delay init x`],
  [`previous x` without init], [`delay none (some x)`; the absence is pushed to consumers],
  [`hold init e`], [`getD e (delay init self)`],
  [`count e`], [`ite (isSome e) (1 + delay 0 self) (delay 0 self)`],
  [`since e`], [`ite (isSome e) 0 (1 + delay 0 self)`],
  [`once e`], [`delay false self ∨ isSome e`],
  [`every n`], [modulo-$n$ counter over `delay`],
  [`rise b`], [`b ∧ ¬ delay false b`, as an optional Boolean],
)
]
State has no identity of its own. A cell is a $upright("delay")$ in a
declaration body, and nothing refers to it because consumers refer to
the declaration. There is consequently no notion of two writers to one
cell in this kernel.

State preserves semantic identity and dimension. The typing rule is
$upright("delay") : tau arrow.r tau arrow.r tau$ for data $tau$, so a
delayed tilt is a tilt and a backward difference over a time step has
dimension $upright("Length") - upright("Time")$ with no derivative
primitive. Provenance holds in the reactive setting too: if no signature
announces a concept and no input carries it, no value at any tick
carries it. Temporal state carries tags; it never creates them.

Initialization is semantic, not validation. Every $upright("delay")$
carries an explicit initial value. Two toy relations without one show
why: the first tick is either undefined or nondeterministic. Adding or
removing a delay, or changing an initial value, is an edit.

== Clock Domains
<clock-domains>
=== Identity, not rate
<identity-not-rate>
“Contact and orientation move with the interaction; temperature moves
with the environment.” A designer can say this before any rate is known,
and it is a statement about which quantities are updated together, not
about how often. BDL records it as a nominal #strong[clock domain],
$upright("ClockId")$, and treats rate as validation data that never
enters the kernel.

The time model is one global base tick and a schedule
$S : upright("ClockId") arrow.r bb(N) arrow.r upright("Bool")$ saying at
which global ticks each domain activates. A period $n$ induces the
schedule $t med mod med n = 0$\; the schedule lives outside the design.
Domain-local time is not a separate counter but the sequence of a
domain's activations.

Each non-agnostic declaration is assigned a domain by a #strong[clock
environment]
$upright(K) : upright("DeclId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("ClockId")$\;
a declaration with no domain is a pure mapping that may serve any
domain. The clock is interface data in every sense that matters ---
clients' validity depends on it, it is frozen under refinement, and
changing it is an edit --- and it is stored as a projection beside the
interface, exactly as a concept's representation is stored in $Theta$
rather than in the type. Whether to fold it into the interface record is
churn rather than semantics.

Rate and identity are distinct. A clone of a domain with the identical
schedule is a different domain, and a direct wire between them is
rejected; a domain at the same rate but shifted in phase reads different
values through a transport. Rate changes are validation-only. They
change the induced schedule and hence the observed values, but no
client's well-formedness. This is where BDL departs from synchronous
languages that recover clocks by inference @colaco2003clocks. The domain
is authored, because the information needed to infer it does not arrive
until realization binding, which in this workflow is the point at which
the designer is least able to make the decision.

=== One transport primitive
<one-transport-primitive>
Cross-domain reading is the second and last temporal form:

$ upright("sync") thick c thick italic(i n i t) thick e\, $

the value of $e$, evaluated in domain $c$, at the last activation of $c$
strictly before the current tick, and $italic(i n i t)$ if there has
been none. The multi-domain evaluation relation
$upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick e thick v$
indexes evaluation by the domain in which it takes place, and its two
transport rules are

$ frac(upright("prevAct") thick S thick c' thick t = upright("none") quad upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick italic(i n i t) thick v, upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick\(upright("sync") thick c' thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) $

$ frac(upright("prevAct") thick S thick c' thick t = upright("some") thick t' quad upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c' thick t' thick rho thick e thick v, upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick\(upright("sync") thick c' thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) . $

$upright("delay")$ is $upright("sync")$ at the expression's own domain:
$upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e equiv upright("sync") thick c thick italic(i n i t) thick e$
in domain $c$, as an equivalence of the two relations. The kernel
therefore has one temporal primitive --- read a domain at its previous
activation --- and the single-domain semantics of the previous section
is its diagonal. Under the always-active schedule, $upright("MEv")$
coincides with $upright("Ev")$ in every domain, so the earlier results
are the one-domain special case rather than a replaced machine. A
`delay` in a slow domain reads three global ticks back where a `delay`
in a fast one reads one, with the same syntax.

A #strong[domain judgment]
$upright("Clocked") thick upright(K) thick c thick e$ rejects every
other cross-domain reference: a reference stays in its domain or is
agnostic, a delay needs a domain, and $upright("sync") thick c'$
switches the domain of its operand. Typing is unchanged and is blind to
domains; the direct wire between two domains at the same value type is
well typed and rejected only by the domain judgment. Placing the domain
in the type instead was tried and set aside. Every pure mapping would
need clock polymorphism, and nothing the type rejects is missed by the
judgment.

=== Strictly before
<strictly-before>
A transport sees only source activations strictly before the destination
tick. That is a choice with an observable alternative, and the
alternative was built. A transport that lets simultaneously active
domains see each other's current values makes the scheduler order
observable: two priorities between the domains give two outputs. The
strictly-before rule has no such parameter, and multi-domain evaluation
is deterministic with no order between simultaneously active domains
appearing in the semantics. It also makes cross-domain causality free. A
transport's operand is never instantaneous, so
$upright("Causal") thick Delta$ is unchanged and no cross-domain cycle
can be instantaneous. Every crossing costs one destination-visible step;
“synchronous sub-domains evaluated in one instant” are, in this model,
the same domain.

Every $upright("sync")$ carries an explicit initial value, used at a
destination activation with no earlier source activation. Totality
extends to the multi-domain case --- a causal, globally well formed
design with well-typed inputs has a value in every domain at every tick
--- so the first activation is deterministic with the stated initial
values. Semantic identity and dimension pass through transport
untouched, by the typing rule; a crossing from `Tilt@fast` to
`Tilt@slow` authorizes neither `Tilt -> MotorAngle` nor
`q Length -> q Time`.

== Cross-domain occurrences and lossless buffering (Phase 9a)
<cross-domain-occurrences-and-lossless-buffering-phase-9a>
Phase 5 left one problem open, and it is worth recording in full because
its resolution shaped the data language.

#strong[The problem.] Within one domain an occurrence is a stream of
optional type: an input delivers at most one value per tick, so `opt τ`
streams are exactly the streams of multiplicity at most one. Across
domains this fails. `sync` is a zero-order hold: a slow consumer of a
fast event source sees the last value only. Phase 5's Counterexample C
(`opt_loses_multiplicity_under_sync`, #strong[executable]) has two fast
events at ticks 1 and 2 and one event at tick 2 indistinguishable at the
slow activation at tick 3, and a single event at tick 1 followed by a
quiet fast tick #emph[dropped] outright. The counterexample is against
`sync` as an #emph[event transport], not against optional types.

#strong[The window model, on tick sets.] What the destination should see
is the source's occurrences at the source activations since the
destination's own previous activation --- the #emph[window]
`windowTicks S src dst t = srcTicks S src (prevAct S dst t) t`. Phase 5
proved (`buffer_from_log_and_cursor`) that this window equals the
source's accumulated log read at the current tick minus the log length
read at the previous destination activation: two single-instant reads, a
`sync` of a source-side accumulator and a `delay` of a cursor. Policies
are functions of the window; `latest`, `count`, and `count` with
`latest` each identify distinct windows (`policies_lose_information`),
and only the list is injective. So multiplicity and order are
observable, buffering is required to keep them, and buffering is a
structured use of the existing state basis #emph[plus list data] ---
which the kernel then lacked.

#strong[The failed abstractions, generalized.] Phase 9a tested the
models the brief named. Model A, `latest`\; B, `count`\; C, a fold such
as a sum; D, a fixed tuple of the newest entries; E, the list. A--D are
lossy, with witnesses (`latest_not_lossless`: `[1,2]` vs `[2]`\;
`count_not_lossless`\; `sum_not_lossless`: `[1,4]` vs `[2,3]`\;
`modelD_not_lossless`). The general statement behind A and D is
`bounded_summary_not_lossless` (#strong[formally proved]): any summary
depending only on the newest `k` entries, for any fixed `k`, identifies
a `k`-entry window with a `(k+1)`-entry window. A lossless summary is
injective and therefore unbounded (`lossless_iff_injective`). The claim
discipline is precise: not that the list is the only lossless
representation, but that any lossless one must be injective on windows
and hence unbounded in size, and that an ordinary list is the smallest
general sequence representation tested.

#strong[The object-language buffer.] With `list τ` (the `Ty.list`
constructor, `Value.list`, and six registered operators `nil`, `cons`,
`length`, `take`, `reverse`, `head`, with `length` yielding `q 0`), the
Phase-5 construction is five ordinary declarations
(`Surface/Buffer.lean`):

```
log     @src :  cons src (delay nil log)             -- source-side accumulator
logD    @dst :  sync src nil log                     -- the log, transported
seen    @dst :  length logD                          -- log length now
cursor  @dst :  delay 0 seen                         -- log length at the previous activation
window  @dst :  reverse (take (seen − cursor) logD)  -- the new entries, oldest first
```

Nothing new is evaluated: `delay`, `sync` and registered operators.
`logD` is the one cross-domain read, an explicit `sync` with the
explicit initial value `nil`. #strong[Theorem M]
(`buffer_window_correspondence`, #strong[formally proved]): for every
schedule, every input, every destination domain and every tick,

$ upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick d s t thick t thick\[thin\]thick upright("window") arrow.b.double upright("list") thin\(upright("map") thin\(I thin s r c\)thin\(upright("windowTicks") thick S thick s r c thick d s t thick t\)\)\, $

whenever the six declarations are realized as above and `src` is an
input. The strictly-before rule is untouched --- the window at `t`
contains source activations `< t` only. The elaboration is well typed in
any environment with the declared types
(`buffer_elaboration_well_typed`) and well clocked with `src`, `log` in
the source domain and the rest in the destination
(`buffer_elaboration_well_clocked`). The list summary is lossless by
injectivity (`buffer_lossless`); its entries are indexed by the window
ticks in strictly increasing order (`window_to_list_preserves_order`),
and for every predicate on values the number of entries satisfying it
equals the number of window activations whose value does
(`window_to_list_preserves_multiplicity`).

#strong[Executed] (`Experiments/BufferAlternatives.lean`, on Phase 5's
multi-rate schedule with fast events at ticks 1 and 2): at the slow
activation 3 the window is `[none, some 1, some 2]`, at 6 it is
`[none, none, none]`, while `latest` sees `some 2` at 3
(`buffer_trace`); the two histories Phase 5 could not tell apart under
`latest` are told apart by the window
(`buffer_distinguishes_what_latest_identifies`); the elaborated design
passes the typing, clocking and causality checkers. The buffer is also a
Phase-8a system with no new binding kind: a sensor component provides
its event #emph[and] its log, a consumer requires the log through an
ordinary transported binding with initial value `nil` and computes the
window (`transport_trace`), whereas binding the event itself through
`sync` yields `latest` and loses the tick-1 event
(`latest_transport_loses`). "Buffer or not" is a choice of #emph[which
provided port to bind], visible in the interface.

#strong[Capacity is a validation obligation.] The kernel model is the
unbounded log. A deployment has finite memory and must show that no
window exceeds its capacity. `CapacitySufficient S src dst cap T` states
that every window up to horizon `T` fits; it is decidable for a finite
horizon; `requiredCapacity` computes the least sufficient value with a
proof (`requiredCapacity_sufficient`); and for periodic schedules the
horizon is unnecessary --- a window never holds more than one
destination period of source activations (`periodic_window_bound`), so
one period is a sufficient capacity at every horizon
(`periodic_capacity_sufficient`). Overflow policies are explicit
functions of the unbounded window --- `dropOldest cap`, `dropNewest cap`
--- and under a sufficient capacity both are the identity
(`sufficient_capacity_preserves`, `bounded_buffer_agrees`); under an
insufficient capacity they change the trace (`negE`, executed: the
three-entry window at tick 3 becomes two entries under either policy,
capacity 2 fails the check at horizon 6, the required capacity at
horizon 30 is 3). Consequently the only overflow policy that preserves
the kernel semantics is to #emph[reject the deployment]\; dropping is a
semantic change and must be written by the designer as ordinary
computation over the window if wanted.

#strong[What is still not a kernel type.] An event stream is a
data-typed declaration in a domain; an occurrence is its value at an
activation; a lossless cross-domain view of it is the five declarations
above; `latest`, `count`, `coalesce`, `drop`, `sample` are ordinary
computations over `window`. None of this needs an `Event` type, a buffer
primitive, a scheduler order, same-tick visibility, an implicit overflow
rule or an effect system, and none was added. The negative examples of
the phase also settle a subtler point: a clone of `fast` with the
identical schedule is a different domain, and listing the value does not
make the direct read legal (`negF`) --- equal rate is not the same
domain, as in Phase 5.

#strong[Production.] Production follows this exactly, with two additions
the formal model deliberately left to engineering (ADR-0024, ADR-0027;
`docs/spec/deployment-capacity.md`). A collection in the generated core
is `alloc::vec::Vec<T>` stored last element first, behind a
`collections` feature of the runtime crate turned on exactly when the
plan carries a list; a program without lists stays allocation-free and
`Copy`. No capacity is imposed by the core and no core ever drops a
value. #emph[The design writes its bounds]: a remembered collection is
bounded by the operators that bound it --- `take cap …` --- and by
nothing else, so the deployable window is the Phase-9a construction with
`take cap` on the log and the count kept apart:

```
count  @fast := 1 + delay 0 count
log    @fast := take cap (cons x (delay [] log))
logD   @slow := sync fast [] log
seen   @slow := sync fast 0 count
cursor @slow := delay 0 seen
window @slow := reverse (take (seen − cursor) logD)
```

With `cap ≥ required(fast → slow)` its `window` equals the unbounded
construction's at every tick --- the production reading of
`bounded_buffer_agrees`, differentially tested across the reference
evaluator, the executable-IR interpreter and the generated core (corpus
`bounded_buffer` against `buffer`, 7 and 3 000 ticks); with `cap`
smaller the oldest values of a window are the ones missing (corpus
`overflowing_buffer`). #emph[The toolchain computes the bound and the
requirement]: a sound static bound per declaration and cell
(`bdl-exec-ir::bounds`), the required window capacity per crossing under
the deployment schedule (`bdl-reactive::capacity`, the production
`Capacity.lean`), a `CollectionsReport` with readiness, byte estimates
and per-crossing requirements, and `deployment.*` diagnostics; an
unbounded state is reported on a host and #strong[refuses the artefact
on a bounded-memory target] (`bdld compile --bounded-memory --period`).
The static bound is an engineering analysis with no theorem behind it
--- recorded as such in Part XIII. A ring buffer specialized for
transport buffers was considered and deferred: the window is not a
construct the compiler can recognize without a surface form (ISS-0001),
and a bounded refinement must be visible in the design to be equivalent
--- `take cap` is exactly that.

= Part VIII --- Behavior Systems
<part-viii-behavior-systems>
Phase 8 asked whether behavior can be a first-class #emph[design
object]: packaged behind an interface, instantiated with fresh identity,
bound to other behaviors, nested, and flattened into the same kernel ---
without any kernel change, without `Event`/`Signal` kernel types,
without a StateHandler kernel, without general effects, and without
name-based identity. Phase 8a answers for reusable components; Phase 8b
for the authoring structure designers form before packaging. The two are
kept apart on purpose, and the distinction is the main result of this
Part.

== Behavior components (Phase 8a)
<behavior-components-phase-8a>
#strong[The requirements report.] The phase began with a requirements
report (`docs/notes/behavior-system-requirements.md`) rather than a
formalization: six capability questions --- can a behavior be reused,
instantiated twice, bound to other behaviors, nested, opened for later
completion, substituted --- and, for each, whether the answer is
REQUIRED of the kernel, OPTIONAL, or DERIVABLE from what exists. The
outcome was that everything is derivable from Phase-1 realization plus
renaming, and the formal development proves it.

#strong[Renaming.] `Ren` bundles four renamings --- declaration
identities, semantic identities, clock identities, output identities ---
and the kernel's judgments are equivariant under it: `HasType.rename`
(typing, given agreement of the three environments on the image; no
injectivity needed), `Satisfies.rename`, `Clocked.rename` (the domain
judgment, for a clock environment that agrees on the declared
identities), and an abstract condition on evidence,
`Evidence.Equivariant`. This is the machinery of Phase 8; nothing else
is new.

#strong[Interfaces and components.] A `Port` is a template declaration
by local identity with the public part of its interface and its
parameter clock. A `BehaviorInterface` has required ports (unresolved
declarations a composer binds), provided ports (declarations offered to
others), elaboration-time parameters (unresolved data-typed declarations
bound to closed constants at instantiation), and clock parameters (the
domains the template is written against). A `BehaviorComponent` is an
interface, a template `Design` over local identities below a width, and
a partition of its concepts and sinks into private (freshened per
instance) and shared. `Realizes ev C` is a predicate over the
#emph[existing] judgments: the template is a well-formed design; every
required port is an unresolved declaration of the stated interface;
every provided port is declared with it; parameters are unresolved,
data-typed and clock-free.

#strong[Fresh instantiation.] `fresh W k n = W·(k+1) + n` maps local
identity `n` of instance `k` into the global space, with `decode` its
inverse; the identities of two distinct instances never coincide
(`inst_decl_disjoint`, Theorem A). The encoding is a device, not a
semantics: any injective allocator would do, and production uses the
same allocator its own ids come from. An instance is a component with a
clock-parameter assignment; `Ren.inst` renames the template's private
identities into the instance's range and its clock parameters to the
assignment.

#strong[Bindings and flattening.] A `Binding` realizes a destination
port of one instance from a source --- a port of another instance, or a
closed constant --- with an optional #emph[transport]: `none` for a
direct reference in the same or an agnostic domain, `some init` for
`sync` from the source's domain with an explicit initial value. A
`BehaviorSystem` is a width, a list of instances, a list of bindings,
the shared concept environment and the external sinks. `flatten` is the
union of the renamed instances followed by the bindings applied as
Phase-1 realization steps: the destination port is realized as
`declRef src` or `sync c init (declRef src)`. The result is an ordinary
`Design`. Every existing pass consumes it unchanged.

#strong[Theorems B--I] (`Behavior/Preservation.lean`, #strong[formally
proved]): under `ComposeWF` --- every instance realizes its interface,
every binding is well formed (`BindingWF`: types agree, a direct
binding's source is in the destination's domain or agnostic, a
transported binding's source has a domain), external sinks are driven by
at most one instance --- the flattening is globally well formed
(`flatten_WF`), causal under an acyclic inter-instance graph
(`flatten_causal`), well clocked (`flatten_wellClocked`), single-driver
(`flatten_singleDriver`); open ports stay open (`open_port_stays_open`).
Evidence must be `Monotone`, `Equivariant` and `PortSound` (a discharged
commitment survives when a port copy is realized by a reference to a
declaration of the same interface); a concrete compositional evidence
model would discharge these once and is still open.

#strong[Semantics] (Theorem J, `Behavior/Semantics.lean`): for wiring
designs with closure-free inputs and #emph[direct] bindings, the value
of a declaration in an instance evaluated alone with a consistent
modular input equals its value in the flattened system
(`eval_flat_to_inst`, `eval_inst_to_flat`, `modular_iff_flat`). The
restriction is exact and recorded: transported bindings under `MEv` need
a domain-indexed input for the transported port, and higher-order bodies
are not covered --- the same obstacle in both directions.

#strong[Substitutability.] `IfaceRefines A B`: `B` may replace `A` when
every port `A` provides, `B` provides with the same type and clock, and
every port `B` requires, `A` required. `substitute_composeWF`: replacing
an instance's component by a refining one preserves composition
well-formedness. `toComponent` packages a whole system as a component of
a chosen interface (the decidable side condition that the chosen
interface is realized is not proved).

#strong[Counterexamples] (`Experiments/BehaviorAlternatives.lean`): a
name-based identity collides on double instantiation; a shared clock
captured inside a template cannot be re-bound; a binding across domains
without transport is rejected by the domain judgment; a binding of a
required port to a wrong type is rejected; two instances driving one
external sink violate single-driver. The lamp system --- a source
instance and two dimmer instances at different domains --- is executed
through the flattening.

#strong[Production] (ADR-0021, ADR-0022; `bdl-system`\;
`docs/architecture/behavior-systems.md`): components, stored port
contracts ("a component interface is a stored promise": the contract is
persisted and checked against the body, so an edit to the body that
breaks the promise is reported at the contract), instances with fresh
identity from the project's allocator, direct and transported bindings,
flattening with an #emph[origin map] back to instances and ports so
diagnostics land on the instance, composition validation, packaging,
versions and substitution. There is one BDL: no system type checker,
evaluator, clock judgment or code generator exists. Every project is a
behavior system --- a design with no components is the degenerate one
--- and the flat design is derived and never persisted. What production
supports beyond the theorem fragment --- transported bindings under the
multi-domain evaluator, higher-order bodies --- is
#emph[production-tested], not proved (Part XIII).

#strong[Multi-clock limitations, exactly.] Theorem J is proved for `Ev`
(one domain) with direct bindings. The clock parameter list must cover
the clocks of declarations and sinks; a `sync` clock appearing only
inside a body is renamed to a fresh domain, harmless for `Ev` and
`Clocked` but something an elaborator should collect. `InstAcyclic`, the
inter-instance graph condition for causality, is too coarse for
extraction (below); a port-level graph would subsume both results.

== Behavior groups (Phase 8b)
<behavior-groups-phase-8b>
#strong[Three things that must not be confused.] A designer who selects
several mapping blocks and chooses #emph[Group as Behavior] has made an
authoring decision, not a semantic one. A designer who later chooses
#emph[Package as Component] has made a semantic decision: from that
point the unit has an interface, can be instantiated with fresh
identity, and can be bound.

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (25%, 25%, 25%, 25%),
    align: (auto,auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([], [mapping /

  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The hierarchy mapping → group → component → system has exactly one
semantic step, packaging, and that step is an elaboration into the
Phase-8a system model.

#strong[Transparency.] A `BehaviorGroup` is a `GroupId` and a list of
member `DeclId`s; a `GroupedDesign` is a `Design` with a list of groups
beside it; `eraseGroups` forgets the list. Every group operation ---
`group`, `ungroup`, `addMember`, `removeMember`, `move`, `merge`,
`split` --- acts on the list and leaves the design untouched, so every
kernel judgment of the erased design is the #emph[same proposition]
before and after (Theorems A--G, each proved by `rfl` or `Iff.rfl`).
That is not a weakness of the theorems; it is the point. Dependency
edges are untouched; nesting is a relation on the flat group list with
no recursive structure. In the Phase-1 vocabulary this is a fourth class
below "validation-only": nothing is rechecked because nothing changed.

#strong[Boundaries as projections.] Over a finite enumeration of the
design's declarations: `crossIn` lists the non-members some member
depends on (the required ports), `crossOut` the members some non-member
depends on (the provided ports), `openMembers` the unresolved members,
`drivenMembers` the members driving a sink, `privateMembers` the rest
(Theorems H--L: `mem_crossIn`, `mem_crossOut`, `internal_not_crossIn`,
`internal_only_not_crossOut`). The aggregate input socket a collapsed
group shows is `crossIn ++ openMembers`\; the output socket is
`crossOut`. None is a declaration. Theorem H, `socket_no_fanout`, is
what makes the socket safe: `a ∈ crossIn` says #emph[some] member
depends on `a` and nothing about the others. Counterexample 6 shows what
goes wrong if the socket is realized as a declaration every member reads
(a member acquires an instantaneous dependency it never had);
Counterexample 5 shows the tuple-returning-declaration encoding (the
consumer of one mapping comes to depend on the inputs of all of them).
The kernel has no tuples for boundaries, and this is a reason not to add
them for this purpose --- the products of Phase 9b are values, not
sockets.

#strong[Inference rules and their counterexamples.] Required =
`crossIn`\; provided = `crossOut`\; private = members neither provided
nor driving a sink; clock parameters = every clock the design uses (a
group owns no domain, so nothing is captured --- Counterexample 3 shows
the reconnecting binding failing its clock condition when a clock is
captured); physical sinks are not ports --- a member that drives a sink
keeps its drive edge inside the component and the sink stays external
(Counterexample 4: converting a sink into a provided port yields a
behavior with no physical effect). Two naive rules are rejected: every
reference of a member as required exposes internal producers and changes
behavior (Counterexample 1); only the members' own open declarations
hides external dependencies and leaves the template ill-typed
(Counterexample 2).

#strong[Extraction.] `Extract` builds two #emph[restrictions] of the
design: the component keeps the members and holds an unresolved copy of
each crossing-in declaration as a required port; the residual keeps the
non-members and holds an unresolved copy of each crossing-out member. It
forms a Phase-8a system --- instance 0 the residual, instance 1 the
component, clock parameters mapped identically --- with one direct
binding per crossing declaration. Each binding is a Phase-1 realization
step: the port copy is realized as a reference to the home copy. No body
is translated, copied across the boundary, or rewritten.
#strong[Formally proved]: both templates realize their inferred
interfaces (`restrict_realizes`, needing `Evidence.InterfaceLocal`: a
discharged commitment depends only on the interfaces of the referenced
declarations); the system is a well-formed composition
(`system_composeWF`) and its flattening a well-formed design (`flat_WF`,
Theorems M--Q); causality needed its own argument --- a group with both
inputs and outputs is never `InstAcyclic`, yet the flattened
instantaneous graph is the original graph with every crossing edge
subdivided through a port copy, and doubling the original rank witnesses
it (`flat_causal`: rank `2·r` on home copies, `2·r + 1` on port copies);
open members stay open; private members are not provided ports, source
no binding, and are never referenced by the residual
(`private_unobservable`); each crossing-out member is its own provided
port (`provided_iff`) --- several independent mappings yield several
independent ports; and behavior is preserved (Theorem R,
`orig_iff_flat`): for a wiring design with closure-free inputs, an
original declaration and its home copy in the flattened extraction
evaluate to the same value at every tick.

#strong[Identity.] Before packaging nothing is renamed. After packaging
the templates keep the original identities, and the flattened system
carries Phase-8a fresh identities: an original `n` lives at `W + n` on
the residual side and `2W + n` on the component side, with a port copy
on the other side where the boundary is crossed; a later second instance
receives `3W + n`. The group's identity never becomes a component
identity.

#strong[Production] (ADR-0019; `.bdl/authoring.json`\;
`ui/layout.json`). A group persists as an identity and its member list
by identity, in the authoring sidecar --- no types, clocks, formulas,
outputs or sockets; anything derived is recomputed and not authoritative
if stored. Collapsed/expanded state, position, size, colour, member
ordering and socket placement are layout and affect no check. Group
operations never trigger semantic invalidation: the workspace does not
re-run typing, causality, clock, output or hardware checks and does not
clear cached verdicts, because these are the same propositions
(`group_is_identity_on_design`). #emph[Package as Component] computes
interface candidates from the member set and lets the designer widen
them --- promote a private member, add an open required port --- but not
narrow below the inferred required set or turn a sink into a semantic
port; the flattened result is guaranteed well formed under the stated
hypotheses, and the causality check passes even though the instance
graph shows edges both ways, so packaging is not gated on `InstAcyclic`.
What cannot be inferred and is asked: whether an unresolved member is
the component's input or an open internal; whether a private member
should nevertheless be exported; whether a member's physical sink is
private to the component; display name and documentation. Packaging a
group #emph[inside] a component body is open (ISS-0007).

== Hardware interaction
<hardware-interaction>
Components partition sinks into private and external. Private sinks are
freshened per instance, so two instances of a component with a private
status LED are two LEDs and two requirements; external sinks are shared
and may be driven by at most one instance in a system
(`ExternalSingleDriver`). Requirements generation (Part X) runs over the
flattened design's sinks, so the number of instances is exactly what the
board must accommodate --- a fact the hardware validator sees only
through the flat design, which is the intended separation.

= Part IX --- The Environment and the Physical Boundaries
<part-ix-the-environment-and-the-physical-boundaries>
Everything in Parts III--VIII happens #emph[between] two boundaries. On
one side the environment provides values --- a tilt, a temperature, a
button state --- and the design observes them; on the other side the
design's values leave it through physical outputs. The kernel's
evaluation relation has no effect component: a derivation relates a
tick, an environment, a term and a value, and both boundaries are named
by things outside the relation --- an input stream on the way in, a
drive edge on the way out. This Part is the account of those two
boundaries as the formal development settled them in four steps: the
canonical type of a relationship that reads nothing and the derived
#emph[source role] (Phase 12, ADR-0029 and ADR-0032); the logical output
("physical sink" in Phase 6's words) with its single explicit driver,
and why the dual form `A -> ()` is not a consumer (Phase 6 and Phase
12); the provision of a Source at deployment by a raw reading and a
device transducer, proved transparent to the design (Phase 13,
PRP-0001); and its output-side dual, the #emph[realization] of a logical
output by a device encoder and a machine sink, proved to change nothing
the behavior observes (Phase 14). The third is the conceptual completion
of the first: a Source is environment provision #emph[at the concept's
type], and provision is the construction that says how a value of that
type comes to exist on a product without the design being able to tell.
The fourth completes the second: an output is semantic intent #emph[at
the concept's type], and realization is the construction that says how a
value of that type leaves the product through PWM, a GPIO level, an I²C
frame or a UART packet --- chosen at deployment, inserted at lowering,
performed only by the backend --- without the behavior being able to
tell either.

The Part is organized by the boundary, not by the phase. The reader who
wants the chronology has Appendix G.

== The canonical type of a relationship that reads nothing
<the-canonical-type-of-a-relationship-that-reads-nothing>
A relationship declared with no inputs ---
`mapping TempSensor : RoomTemp`, `mapping boost : Brightness` --- is
typed by the kernel at its output: `expectedType = B`. Production
(ADR-0029) gives the same relationship a #emph[canonical type]
`() -> B`, with `()` the empty product, so that every relationship has
one type shape `domain(inputs) -> B`: `domain([]) = ()`,
`domain([A]) = A`, `domain([A, B, …]) = A × (B × …)`. The surface spells
`mapping f : B` as shorthand for `mapping f : () -> B`\; `f`, `f()` and
`f(())` are one reference; `()` is refused as a value anywhere else, as
an output, and as a value form; hover and Explain show the canonical
type and the sentence "its canonical domain is `()`, the empty product;
the kernel encodes `() -> B` as `B`". Production's `bdl_ir::Ty` has a
`Unit` constructor for this --- a real IR type with the ordinary
predicates --- that never types a Core term, a representation or a
runtime value. ISS-0014 asked whether the kernel and the canonical type
agree by theorem.

Phase 12 (`Surface/UnitDomain.lean`) answers without adding a unit to
the kernel. The canonical types live in an #emph[interface layer] above
it --- `CTy` is the kernel's `Ty` plus `unit`, interface arrows and
domain products --- and the kernel interface type is the value of a
normalization function on them (#strong[formally proved]):

$ upright(e l i m)\(upright(c a n o n i c a l)\(s\)\)= upright(e n c o d e)\(s\)\,#h(2em) upright(e n c o d e)\(chevron.l\[thin\]\,B chevron.r\)= B\,quad upright(e n c o d e)\(chevron.l A_1\,dots.h\,A_n\;B chevron.r\)= A_1 arrow.r dots.h.c arrow.r A_n arrow.r B\, $

where `elim` performs unit elimination (`() -> B ↦ B`) and currying
(`(A × B) -> C ↦ A -> (B -> C)`), is total by a weight both steps
decrease, and has no value on the bare unit --- `elim () = none`: the
unit is never the type of anything. The encodings are inverse over every
signature whose output is not an arrow, hence over every concept
signature (`decode_encode`, `canonicalOfKernel_encode`,
`encode_injective`, `canonical_injective`), which is production's
inverse test as a theorem for all signatures. The categorical slogan
`Hom(1, B) ≅ B` is thus, in this model, definitional at the kernel (the
realization obligation of `() -> B` #emph[is] `⊢ e : B` in the empty
context, `zero_input_obligation`, by `Iff.rfl`), a theorem at the
interface (the inverse pair), and a bijection denotationally
(`homUnit : (1 → β) ≅ β`).

Why the unit is eliminated #emph[before] the kernel is a theorem, not a
preference. The literal alternative --- realize `() -> B` as a lambda
over the unique argument and read it by application --- is refused by
typing: no term `λx. delay i e` has any type, for any binder domain,
because `delay` and `sync` are typed only in the empty context
(`delay_not_under_binder`, `sync_not_under_binder`), while
`delay init e : B` is a legal realization of `() -> B` under the kernel
encoding (`zero_input_memory`). A kernel unit binder would forbid memory
in every zero-input declaration; a counter
`boost := delay 0 (boost + 1)` would become untypable. `lams_typed`
states the general case: a formula body checked in the context of its
inputs is a realization of the encoded type under `n` binders, and for
no inputs there is no binder.

The three spellings are one term (`refForms_agree`), so they share
typing, evaluation and the clock judgment by reflexivity
(`HasType.refForms`, `Clocked.refForms`). Two theorems say what the
unique argument could have carried, and that it carries nothing: a
reference's value at a tick is independent of the local environment ---
a realized declaration evaluates in the empty environment, an unresolved
one is read from the input stream (`Ev.declRef_env_irrelevant`,
`MEv.declRef_env_irrelevant`) --- and two readings in one tick agree
under any two environments (`same_tick_same_value`). There is no
per-reference call to repeat; a zero-input declaration is evaluated as a
declaration, once per activation, and the reader observes that value. No
unit clock, no extra activation, no evaluation step.

#strong[The source role is a realization state, not a type shape.]
`() -> A` describes the shape of a signature; a #emph[source] is a
declaration with no realization, whose value at every tick is provided
by the environment: `Source Δ d := realizationOf d = none`, and
`source_value` gives that value as `I(d, t)` in every domain and under
every environment --- indexed by the declaration and the tick alone,
which is the formal sense in which the unit argument carries no temporal
or environmental information. A resolved `() -> A` never consults the
input stream (`resolved_not_source`); it is not a sensor, and every
mathematical `() -> A` is not one either. Production's #emph[simulation
input] --- Studio offers a declaration as an input when it is unresolved
and unit-domain --- is `SimulationInput := Source ∧ UnitDomain`, a
narrowing the kernel does not need (its input stream provides a value
for every unresolved declaration, arrow-typed ones included) and that is
recorded as surface policy over the same semantics: on a unit-domain
source the two agree (`SimulationInput.value`). No `source` kind exists
in either model; production's `Signature::is_unit_domain` is the one
predicate, and the formal `UnitDomain Δ d` is the same predicate on the
kernel type.

The two production consequences of the unit domain are corollaries of
existing rules (#strong[formally proved]). Only a data value --- never a
function --- can be remembered or transported: a well-typed `sync` or
`delay` of a reference forces the referenced type to be data, hence not
an arrow, hence unit-domain (`transport_needs_unit_domain`,
`delay_needs_unit_domain`) --- production's diagnostic #emph[f has
inputs, so its value cannot be carried across timing domains] is this
theorem's message. And a driver of a sink is a value of the accepted
type, so when the sink accepts a concept the driver is unit-domain
(`driver_is_unit_domain`, from `DriveWF`). The dual form `A -> ()` is
taken up below.

Executed (#strong[executable example],
`Experiments/UnitDomainExamples.lean`): the lamp's signatures round-trip
through both encodings and `elim` computes them;
`boost := delay 0 (boost + 1)` read as `boost`, `boost()` and
`boost(())` gives `0, 1, 3` at ticks `0, 1, 3`, and the same under a
non-empty local environment; the unresolved `TempSensor` reads the input
while `boost` ignores it entirely; `infer` accepts `delay … : Q0` in the
empty context and refuses a binder around it; `sync` of `boost` and of
`TempSensor` is typed and `sync` of the one-input `dimByTilt` is
refused.

Verdicts (#strong[informed by FV]): unit in the canonical interface
notation --- keep, above the kernel; a kernel unit type, a unit runtime
value, a unit term --- remove; a source semantic kind --- remove, derive
from the realization state; the source surface role --- keep in the
surface; `A -> ()` as a physical sink --- remove (below); the
output/drive boundary --- keep. Production's correspondence row for
ADR-0029 reads #emph[formally proved (model)] at the interface and
#emph[transcribed] at the kernel encoding, and ISS-0014 is resolved.

=== Source, Rule, Value: production's reading of the realization state
<source-rule-value-productions-reading-of-the-realization-state>
Production reads the two kernel facts a declaration carries --- does its
type have inputs, does it have a realization --- as one derived
#strong[relationship role] (ADR-0032, amended 2026-09-20;
`bdl_model::RelationshipRole`):

```
role(x) = Rule    if x reads something          (its canonical type is an arrow)
        = Value   if x reads nothing and has a realization
        = Source  if x reads nothing and has none
```

The role is derived, never persisted, never authored, and distinct from
every #emph[state]: a declared rule, an invalid formula, a rule nothing
applies, a driven value, a bound port, a clocked declaration are states
that vary within a role and never move it. #emph[Has a realization]
means an attached definition --- a formula whether or not it checks, the
reference a binding made, memory, a constant, a parameter's argument ---
and never a draft; the role follows the committed revision. The rule has
one home, `MappingBlock::role`\; the compiler states it in
`MappingAnalysis.role`, the daemon on every `MappingView.role` (protocol
0.20), and Studio maps the enum and re-derives nothing. The earlier
arrangement, in which Studio derived a Source from the shape of the
projection, was replaced by this one authority on 2026-09-20 and is not
what the product does.

Only the Source case has a formal object:
`Source Δ d := realizationOf d = none` on the unit domain (FVD-0118,
`source_value`, `resolved_not_source`). #emph[Rule] and #emph[Value] are
production's names for the arrow type and the realized unit domain; the
kernel has no need to distinguish a Value from a Rule beyond typing, and
none was added. The role crosses the component boundary as a fact of
#emph[one design]: the relationship behind a required port is a Source
of the body, provided through the port; a provided port realized inside
is a Value; an unbound required port of an instance is a Source of the
system (Theorem H, Part VIII); a base relationship a binding realizes is
a Value at the top level because its flattened copy carries the binding.
Production's `relationship-roles.md` is the normative matrix.

Two consequences the kernel already fixed, restated in the role
vocabulary. #strong[A Source may drive an output.] `DriveWF` (Part IX
below; FVD-0051) requires the driver's type to equal the sink's accepted
type and its domain to be the sink's; it mentions realization nowhere.
So a Source --- a value the environment supplies --- may be passed
straight to a light, and production's output pass accepts it; a Rule is
refused because its type is an arrow (`output.type_mismatch`). Any
statement that #emph[only a Value can drive an output] is stale.
#strong[A provisioned Source is a Value.] After Phase 13's provision
(below) the target has a realization, so the same rule gives the same
answer: no `ProvisionedSource` role exists or is needed (ADR-0032's
amendment; FVD-0127, `provision_source_role`).

#strong[Applied rules.] A Rule has no value at a tick --- it is a
function --- so the simulator shows it no column, and it does work only
when a Value applies it. Production states, per analysis, `references`
(the declarations a realization names by identity --- the kernel's
`DependsOn`) and `applied_by`, its #strong[direct] inverse, never a
transitive closure; a rule nothing applies is reported as
`reactive.rule_unapplied` (informational) and the value that would apply
it is offered as the action `rule.apply`. These are IDE and product
facts over the dependency graph of Part III, not kernel kinds, and the
monograph treats them as such.

#strong[Commitments, exactly.] The kernel gives every declaration a
commitment list and makes evidence for it part of well-formedness (Part
III); Phase 13's `provision_wf` needs evidence for each target's
commitments on its new realization (FVD-0128). Production authors no
commitments at the snapshot: `require` is a reserved word without a
production, every declaration's commitment list is empty, and no
commitment solver exists. The formal hypothesis is therefore
#emph[vacuous] in production today, and this document does not present a
production commitment mechanism as implemented.

== Physical outputs without arbitration
<physical-outputs-without-arbitration>
=== The model
<the-model>
A declaration computes a value; it does not move hardware. Physical
effect happens only through an explicit #strong[drive edge] from a
declaration to a #strong[logical output] --- Phase 6 called it a
#emph[physical sink], meaning #emph[outside the behavior, terminal], and
Phase 14 (below) fixes the reading: it is the behavior's semantic intent
at the boundary, physically realized by a deployment-chosen machine
sink. The Lean names are unchanged, and the relation `PhysicalOutput`
--- the value a logical output carries at a tick --- keeps its
historical name; the machine sink is Phase 14's `p`:

- $upright("OutputId")$ --- the nominal identity of a sink, a logical
  actuator channel;
- $Omega : upright("OutputId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("OutputSpec")$,
  a sink's accepted type and clock, declared by the deployment;
- $beta : upright("DeclId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("OutputId")$
  --- the drive edges, a write-once per-declaration projection of the
  same shape as $upright(K)$\;
- $upright("DriveWF") thick Omega thick upright(K) thick Delta thick beta$
  --- each edge is well formed when the driver's expected type
  #emph[equals] the sink's accepted type and the driver's clock is the
  sink's clock;
- $upright("SingleDriver") thick beta$ --- at most one driver per sink:
  if $beta thick d_1$ and $beta thick d_2$ are both
  $upright("some") thick o$ then $d_1 = d_2$\;
- $upright("CompleteOutputs") thick beta thick italic(r e q)$ --- every
  required sink is driven.

Nothing was added to types, typing, the domain judgment, the evaluation
relation, or the grant. The binding neither coerces nor converts nor
synchronizes. A declaration typed `Tilt`, or bare `q Angle`, cannot
drive a `MotorAngle` sink. A sink that accepts a representation type
needs an explicit `rep`-typed declaration in front of it, so the
distinction between semantic target and hardware representation stays
visible. A slow driver reading a fast value must $upright("sync")$ it
upstream, since a fast driver cannot drive a slow sink and the edge
never synchronizes.

Sink identity is nominal for the same reason concept identity is. Keying
the binding by type collides when two servos accept the same type;
keying by concept conflates a concept with a device, since one concept
may feed several; keying by declaration makes two declarations that both
mean the steering motor into two sinks, and the multiple-driver
counterexample cannot even be stated. “Desired steering angle” is a
value; “the steering motor” is a resource; the kernel keeps them in
different sorts.

=== One final driver
<one-final-driver>
The principle is #emph[many contributors, one explicit final driver].
Take two declarations driving one sink, each globally well typed, well
clocked, causal, and individually well formed. Only
$upright("SingleDriver")$ fails, and it fails globally rather than at
either edge. What has gone wrong is semantic: with two drivers the
physical output is not a function of the tick, and there is a tick at
which the sink receives two values. With one driver, the physical output
is a partial function of the tick, and with $upright("SingleDriver")$ it
is unique wherever it exists:

$  & upright("PhysicalOutput") thick S thick Delta thick I thick Omega thick beta thick o thick t thick v thick := thick exists d thin italic(s p e c) .\
 & quad beta thick d = upright("some") thick o thick and thick Omega thick o = upright("some") thick italic(s p e c)\
 & quad and thick upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick italic(s p e c) . italic(c l o c k) thick t thick\[\]thick\(upright("declRef") thick d\)thick v . $

Contributors are dependencies, not drivers.
`base + corr -> final -> motor` passes every check; priority is an
ordinary conditional in the single driver; blend, maximum, and clamp are
ordinary declarations of the target type. Why arbitration must be
explicit is best shown rather than argued: first-wins, last-wins, and
maximum over the same value graph give three different physical outputs.
A hidden policy is a design decision made on the designer's behalf.

Binding an unbound declaration to an undriven sink is a refinement and
preserves $upright("SingleDriver")$. Binding to an already-driven sink
is invalid. Retargeting a sink's accepted type, renaming a sink, or
detaching an edge invalidates an unchanged design. Partial designs may
leave sinks undriven; executable designs may not.

=== What was removed
<what-was-removed>
The earlier draft of BDL had an effect row on the behavior judgment,
action requests as values, and per-context policies that allowed,
suppressed, transformed, and arbitrated requests, resolved in a
dedicated phase of each tick. Each was tried in toy form against the
single-driver model, and the outcome is narrow. Direct effect rows ---
the set of sinks a declaration drives --- are exactly the drive edges,
and single-driver is exactly their pairwise disjointness. Propagated
rows, which also include the sinks of everything a declaration reads,
flag a valid design in which a display reads the driver. Action values
move the conflict into the collector that consumes them, which must then
be a policy, which is the single driver by another name. None of this
bears on richer effect systems; it says that these formulations add no
rejection the single-driver rule lacks. Per-context action policies no
longer exist as a mechanism, and the StateHandler cases that involved
them --- event-latched activation with exit-wins, state-local output
choice, nested choice with an output --- are ordinary declarations with
one driver and were run as such.

=== Why `A -> ()` is not a sink
<why-a---is-not-a-sink>
Once zero-input relationships have the canonical type `() -> A` (above),
the dual form suggests itself: could a physical consumer be a
relationship `A -> ()`, a function that takes a value and returns
nothing? The kernel has no unit type, so the form cannot be written;
Phase 12 records why it should not become writable (#strong[formally
proved], denotationally). In a pure total language every function into
the one-point type is the same function ---
`unit_codomain_collapse : ∀ f g : A → 1, f = g`, by function
extensionality alone --- so two "consumers" `sink₁ sink₂ : A -> ()` are
indistinguishable (`consumers_indistinguishable`): nothing in a value of
that type says #emph[which] physical output receives `A`, or that
anything receives it at all. The kernel's evaluation relation has no
effect component (`eval_independent_of_drives`); a derivation relates a
tick, an environment, a term and a value, and the physical consequence
of a value lives outside it. Naming a receiver needs an effect or output
semantics, and BDL already has exactly one: the sink identity
`OutputId`, the drive edge with `DriveWF` (the driver's type equals the
accepted type, in the sink's domain), `SingleDriver` and
`CompleteOutputs`. The receiver is named by the edge, the value
delivered is the driver's, of type `A`, and the driver is a unit-domain
declaration whenever the sink accepts a concept
(`driver_is_unit_domain`). This is a design result, not a preference:
physical consumption stays on the drive boundary, and `A -> ()` is
removed from consideration.

== Provision: how a Source gets its value on a product
<provision-how-a-source-gets-its-value-on-a-product>
A Source `s : () -> C` is environment provision at the concept's type:
the kernel input gives a `Temperature`, and nothing in the design or in
the kernel says how a value of `Temperature` comes to exist. On a
product it does not. An ADC yields counts, a GPIO a level, an I²C sensor
a register image. The gap between the abstract Source and the physical
reading is the last boundary the formal development had to settle, and
the shape of the answer is fixed by everything before it: no new kernel
construct, no Source kind, no effect, and no way for the design to tell
the difference.

The picture, before the theorems:

```
abstract Source      s : () -> C           unresolved; its value is the environment's, at type C
raw provider         r : () -> R           a fresh unresolved declaration at the device's raw type
device channel       tr : R -> Rep(C)      a pure term with its transfer function, from a device profile
provisioned Source   s := mk C (tr r)      an ordinary realization; s is now a Value
```

The design file keeps `mapping TempSensor : () -> RoomTemp`\; the
deployment supplies `r`, `tr` and the realization; the consumer `tooHot`
computes the same truth values from counts as it did from the induced
temperature. The key result is a containment, and the direction matters:
every trace of the provisioned design under a raw input is a trace of
the abstract design under the induced input ---
#strong[`Trace(device) ⊆ Trace(abstract)`] --- and this strict
refinement is the #emph[normal, intended] case. A saturating ADC never
yields 451 K; the abstract design admits that observation and the
provisioned one does not; nothing is wrong. Trace #emph[equality] needs
a #strong[joint section] --- one raw trace every channel transfers to
what the abstract input gives its target --- and the absence of a joint
section is not a deployment error and is reported by no surface.
Production's proposal PRP-0001 asked for this construction in seven
claims; Phase 13 built it, kept three of the claims, and corrected four.
What follows is the construction and the corrections (#strong[formally
proved] unless marked; `Surface/Provision.lean`\; FVD-0121 … FVD-0130;
PRP-0001 remains a draft, revised, and nothing in production implements
it).

#strong[The construction.] A #emph[channel] is a representation type
`rep`, a term `tr`, its transfer function `transfer` on values, and the
coherence `computes` (the term computes the function on every raw-typed
value); the term is #strong[pure] --- no `declRef`, `delay` or `sync`. A
#emph[device profile] is a raw type (sem-free data) and its channels; it
mentions no concept. A #emph[provision] is one fresh raw declaration `r`
with its clock and an assignment of channels to target Sources ---
several targets may share one raw reading (an IMU image feeding pitch,
roll and acceleration), and one target is the singleton case. Then

$ upright(p r o v i s i o n)\(Delta\,P\)med = med Delta thin\[thin r mapsto chevron.l italic(r a w)\,\[thin\]chevron.r med upright("unresolved") thin\]thin\[thin s mapsto upright(m k)_c thin\(upright(t r) med\(upright(d e c l R e f) med r\)\)med upright("for each target ") s : upright(s e m) med c thin\]\, $

with `tr (declRef r)` alone at a representation-typed Source; the raw
declaration's kernel type is `raw` and its canonical type `() -> raw`
(above). Fitting is decidable: at `sem c` the concept's representation
is the channel's; at a representation type the types coincide. Nothing
enters the kernel: `provision` is a function on environments built from
`DesignDecl`, `declRef`, `app` and `mk`.

#strong[Why purity, and why a transfer function.] Typing the channel
term in the #emph[empty] design already forbids reading a declaration
(`Channel.WF_refFree`), but not memory: `(λk. λn. k) (delay 0 1)` is
typed at `q₀ → q₀` and maps the raw value 7 to 0 at tick 0 and to 1 at
tick 1 (`exD`, #strong[executable example]). A transducer must be a
function of the raw reading, so the profile condition is purity ---
equivalently, typed in the empty design and delay-free
(`pure_iff_delayFree_of_wf`). The channel carries `transfer` beside `tr`
because the #emph[induced] abstract input must be a function: extracting
it from per-tick existence of a value would be a choice principle, which
this development does not use. The grant argument the proposal relied on
is a theorem of the existing rules: a declaration typed `sem c` is
realized under `Grant.of (sem c) = {c}`
(`realization_checked_under_own_grant`, `grant_of_sem`), and a channel
term typed under `Grant.none` constructs nothing
(`channel_constructs_nothing`); the same `λx. mk RoomTemp x` is refused
under the empty grant and accepted under the Source's own (`exC`).

#strong[Structure.] Provision is an environment refinement
(`provision_envRefines`): each target keeps its identity and interface
and goes from unresolved to realized, `r` is new, nothing else moves.
The provisioned design is globally well formed (`provision_wf`) from the
abstract design's well-formedness, monotone evidence, the provision's
preconditions --- and evidence for each target's #emph[commitments] on
its new realization, a hypothesis the proposal did not state: a Source's
commitments are obligations on the profile. Causality is preserved with
the rank shifted by one and `r` at the bottom; purity keeps the channel
term edge-free (`provision_causal`). The domain judgment is preserved
with `Κ r = Κ s` (`provision_wellClocked`); no device clock is
introduced, and a device with its own rate is a later `sync`.

#strong[Transparency.] For every schedule, domain, tick, term that does
not mention `r`, and local environment whose closures avoid `r`,

$ upright(M E v) med S med Delta med I med c med t med rho med e med v med arrow.l.r.double med upright(M E v) med S med\(upright(p r o v i s i o n) thin Delta thin P\)med I' med c med t med rho med e med v\,#h(2em) I = upright(i n d u c e d)\(Delta\,P\,I'\)\, $

where the induced input gives each target the wrapped transfer of the
raw reading and leaves every other identity as `I'` gives it
(`provision_transparent`). The hypotheses the proposal lacked are
stated: the raw input is typed at `r` and closure-free, and the abstract
design mentions no `r` --- true of every globally well-typed design
(`NoMention.of_globalWF`). The observation boundary has two equivalent
forms: syntactic (`r ∉ e.refs`) and by typing (a term typed in the
abstract design cannot name `r`, `provision_transparent_typed`). The
proof is one simulation lemma over `MEv` with the closure invariant "no
closure body mentions `r`", instantiated in both directions and once
more for input congruence; the provisioned target's value comes from the
pure term's canonical evaluation transported to any design, input,
domain and tick (`Transduces.mev`, `MEv.of_ev_pure`) --- at top level,
where a realization is evaluated, which is what avoids a
closure-equivalence theorem. Physical outputs are unchanged
(`provision_physicalOutput`).

#strong[Trace abstraction, exactness, strictness.] Every behaviour of
the provisioned design under a raw input is a behaviour of the abstract
design under the induced input (`provision_abstracts`): deployment
#emph[restricts] the abstract environment; it does not give the abstract
design its meaning. The proposal's converse --- "when the transducer is
surjective the trace sets are equal" --- is wrong as stated: pointwise
surjectivity is an existence per tick, and with a shared raw reading it
is insufficient even in principle (`id` and `succ` from one reading are
each onto, and the abstract pair `(5, 9)` has no witness,
`no_joint_witness`). Equality needs a #emph[joint section], a raw trace
every channel transfers to what the abstract input gives its target
(`provision_exact`); for one channel a pointwise right inverse on typed
values is one (`JointSection.one`). The strict case is executed: a
saturating ADC never yields 451 K, the abstract design observes
`TempSensor = 451 K`, and no provisioned deployment does (`exE`).

#strong[Re-application and commutation.] The proposal called provision
"idempotent per Source". After provision a target is realized, is no
longer a Source, and the operation's precondition fails because `r` is
no longer fresh (`provision_not_reapplicable`\; the Source role moves to
`r`, `provision_source_role`). The totalized function does satisfy
`P(P(Δ)) = P(Δ)` (`provision_idem_total`) --- only because a second pass
overwrites every target with the same body; a second pass with a
different term is not a refinement
(`provision_reprovision_not_refinement`). Independent provisions commute
#emph[exactly], as environment equality (`provision_comm`), and the
channel assignment is a set (`provision_perm`).

#strong[Executed] (`Experiments/ProvisionExamples.lean`): the identity
GPIO channel on a `bool` Source; the thermistor `T = 2n + 250 K` on
`TempSensor`, with the consumer `tooHot` computing the same truth values
from counts as from the induced temperature and the provisioned design
proved refining, causal and well clocked; rejected profiles; the impure
typed term; the saturating ADC; one IMU image provisioning `pitch` and
`roll` with `level` reading both.

#strong[What changed in the proposal] (#strong[design recommendation]):
the purity condition; the transfer function beside the term; the
commitment hypothesis; the transparency hypotheses; the joint-section
exactness; "not re-applicable" for "idempotent"\; shared raw as the
primitive with the singleton as its case; the terminology ---
#emph[abstract Source], #emph[provisioned Source], #emph[raw
declaration], never "monomorphised", which Part V's rank-1 polymorphism
owns; and the removal of the dependency on designer-facing °C/°F
(ISS-0004): the thermistor is a linear chart on counts and the language
keeps kelvin. The output side, which the proposal left as a duality
note, is Phase 14's subject below: it is not a provision at all but a
lowering, and the asymmetry is the result. Verdict: provision is a
deployment/surface construction over existing kernel terms, not a kernel
construct (FVD-0121). The proposal stays a draft, revised, for human
review; nothing in production implements it.

#strong[A shared raw reading.] One inertial-measurement image feeds
pitch, roll and acceleration; one thermistor feeds one temperature.
Phase 13 made the shared reading the primitive --- a provision is
#emph[one] fresh raw declaration with its clock and an assignment of
channels to target Sources --- and the singleton the special case
(`Provision.one`\; FVD-0125), because the joint-section finding is
invisible in the singleton: with one raw reading and two channels each
pointwise onto its target, `id` and `succ`, the abstract pair `(5, 9)`
has no raw witness (`no_joint_witness`, #strong[counterexample]). The
shared case is the realistic one, and stating every theorem for it and
instantiating the singleton (`WF.one`, `provisionOne_transparent`,
`induced_one`) costs nothing.

#strong[Where the pieces will live.] Production has decided, in advance
of building any of it (ADR-0032's amendment; `relationship-roles.md` §
Phase 13), what owns what when PRP-0001 is implemented: the device
profile and raw type in a #strong[device catalogue] (`hardware/`, never
the Standard Library, which is an authoring catalogue of fragments); the
transducer as a checked BDL formula; #emph[Fits] in deployment analysis;
the provision transformation in the compiler's deployment pass; the raw
input in the platform adapter; the induced input as a testing oracle.
None of it exists at the snapshot (ISS-0016; #strong[proposal / not
implemented]).

#strong[What stays open] (FVI-0020): memory in a transducer (a
debouncing or filtering channel is not a function of the raw reading,
and the transparency and exactness theorems are stated over functions
--- a stream-level theorem would be needed); a device clock, `Κ r ≠ Κ s`
with a `sync` at deployment (the transport exists; the construction
would add one declaration per target); how a profile's declared range
discharges a Source's commitments, once production authors any; output
provision, the dual; whether `computes` is checked by the compiler or
trusted from the catalogue with differential tests; and out-of-type raw
readings, a validation question.

#strong[Behavior semantics and realization, once more.] The separation
this Part makes explicit --- on both sides now, provision on the way in
and realization on the way out --- is the one Parts X--XI depend on.
#emph[Behavior semantics] is environment-provided inputs (`I(d, t)`),
pure internal computation (`Ev`/`MEv`) and output obligations
(`DriveWF`, `CompleteOutputs`, `PhysicalOutput`). #emph[Realization] is
sensor reads, ADCs and buses on the input side, and GPIO, PWM and device
I/O on the output side --- the platform adapter's business, named
nowhere in the kernel. A Source is not a read; a drive edge is not a
write. Provision is the theorem that the input side of that separation
can be crossed by a construction the design cannot observe; realization
(below) is the theorem that the output side can be crossed by one the
behavior cannot observe either --- and that, unlike provision, it
changes nothing at all in the behavior.

== Realization: how an output reaches the world
<realization-how-an-output-reaches-the-world>
The drive edge names a receiver and delivers a value of the accepted
type; it says nothing about how the receiver is built. A behavior that
drives `Light accepts Brightness` has not decided whether the product
dims a lamp by a PWM duty cycle, a GPIO level through a relay, an I²C
brightness register or a UART packet to a lighting controller. Phase 14
(`Surface/OutputRealization.lean`) is the account of why it never has
to: the #emph[logical output] of Phase 6 is exactly the
platform-independence boundary, and the mechanism is a deployment
construction downstream of it.

#strong[What an output is, after this phase.] `OutputId`,
`OutputSpec = ⟨accepts, clock⟩`, the drive edge and `SingleDriver` are
unchanged, and they are read as the #strong[logical output]: the
behavior's intent that the product carry `C` at the output's clock,
terminal (no feedback), physically #emph[realized] by deployment. Phase
6 called it a physical sink; the word meant #emph[outside the behavior],
not #emph[a device], and FVD-0050 carries the dated amendment. Nothing
about a device is in the spec --- no `deviceKind`, no protocol --- and
no concept implies one: `Brightness` does not mean PWM, `SwitchState`
does not mean GPIO. This is a design rule (FVD-0131) with an executed
witness (`exH`): one `oLight` realized by PWM and by an I²C register has
one behavior trace.

#strong[Three stages, and where each decision lives.]

    driving a machine sink; the backend consumes the command], [the
    compiler, the platform adapter],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#strong[The encoder.] An `Encoder` is
`⟨rep, raw, encode, transfer, …, computes⟩`: a #strong[pure] term
`encode : rep -> raw` typed in the empty design under `Grant.none`, both
`rep` and `raw` sem-free data, the transfer function on values, and the
coherence `computes`. Purity is necessary for the same reason as on the
Source side: `(λk. λn. k) (delay 0 1)` is typed at `q₀ -> q₀` and
encodes the same value as 0 at tick 0 and 1 at tick 1 (`exEFG`); a
device transfer is a function of the current value or it is something
else (a stateful adapter, Part XV). The nominality boundary runs the
other way from provision: the encoder #emph[observes] the driver's
representation through `rep`, which needs no grant, and the encoder
declaration, typed at a sem-free data type, has no grant at all
(`encoder_constructs_nothing`, `encoder_decl_no_grant`, #strong[formally
proved]); `λx. mk Other x` is refused under `Grant.none` and accepted
only under `Other`'s own grant, which no encoder holds. Fitting is
decidable --- `EFits`: at `sem c` the concept's representation is the
encoder's; at a data type the types coincide.

#strong[Two models, one specification.] The tempting construction ---
retarget `o.accepts` to the raw type and drive an encoder into it --- is
refuted: the existing edge `d -> o` fails `DriveWF` because the driver
is typed at the concept (`retarget_breaks_driveWF`, #strong[formally
proved]\; executed in `exI`), so `β` would have to be rewritten and the
abstract output's meaning lost; Phase 6 already calls retargeting an
edit. What survives is a pair. The #emph[specification] is a relation on
the unchanged design, `RawCommand S Δ I Ω β R t w`: the command
#emph[specified] for realization `R` at tick `t` is `transfer` of what
`o` carries (`PhysicalOutput`). The machine sink `p` does not occur in
it --- it says what the command is, not who receives it; that the
lowered design's `p` carries exactly this command is the theorem below,
not the definition. This is the machine boundary --- a relation on
commands, not a term; the backend that consumes it is outside the
semantics, and no effectful `R -> ()`, `Expr.write`, effect row or `IO`
exists (FVD-0134; the reason is the `A -> ()` result above). The
#emph[lowering] implements it in the existing kernel:

$ Delta' = Delta\[thin e mapsto chevron.l italic(r a w)\,\[thin\]chevron.r := upright(e n c o d e) thin\(upright(r e p) thin\(upright(d e c l R e f) med d\)\)thin\]\,quad Omega' = Omega\[thin p mapsto chevron.l italic(r a w)\,italic(c l o c k)_o chevron.r thin\]\,quad beta' = beta\[thin e mapsto p thin\]\,quad upright(K)' = upright(K)\[thin e mapsto italic(c l o c k)_o thin\]\, $

with `o`, `d`, the edge `d -> o` and every other declaration untouched.
The new edge is Phase 6's #emph[first binding] --- a refinement of the
drive edges that preserves single-driver (`lower_singleDriver`); the
lowered design is well typed, globally well formed, causal (one new edge
`e -> d`, `e` on top) and well clocked with `e` in the output's clock
(`lower_driveWF`, `lower_wf`, `lower_causal`, `lower_wellClocked`,
#strong[formally proved]).

#strong[Behavior preservation is literal, not observational.] Off the
fresh identity `e` the behavior environment #emph[is] the original
(`behavior_unchanged`, definitional); every pre-existing term evaluates
identically under the #emph[same] input --- there is no induced input on
the output side, because outputs do not feed evaluation
(`lower_transparent`); every logical output, `o` included, carries the
same value (`lower_physicalOutput_unchanged`). This is the asymmetry
with provision: Source provision realizes an unresolved declaration and
moves the source role to the raw reading; output realization adds
downstream structure only, and no declaration changes state.
`EnvRefines Δ Δ'` holds, but trivially, and it is not the interesting
relation; the interesting fact is `Δ' x = Δ x` for every `x` the
behavior knows.

#strong[Correspondence, directional.] The central theorem is
`lower_correspondence`: the machine sink's value in the lowered design
is exactly the specified command,

$ upright(P h y s i c a l O u t p u t)\(Delta'\,p\,t\,w\)med arrow.l.r.double med upright(R a w C o m m a n d)\(Delta\,R\,t\,w\)\,#h(2em) upright("i.e.") quad upright("raw trace") = upright(t r a n s f e r) compose upright("abstract trace")\, $

tick by tick in the output's clock, under: a well-formed single-driver
drive environment, a design that mentions no `e` (every globally
well-typed design), inputs whose closures avoid `e`, and a logical
output carrying typed representation values --- which Phase 5's totality
supplies in a causal, well-formed design (`output_value_typed`). The
theorem is an equivalence of #emph[observations at `p`], but the
construction is directional by nature: `p` is downstream of `o`, nothing
flows back, and no "induced output" exists. Nor is any exactness needed:
two abstract values may encode to one command --- a 4-bit PWM sends duty
6 for 40 % and for 41 % (`exB_quantized`) --- and a round-trip
`decode(encode x) = x` is neither assumed nor provable; the
profile-declared transfer #emph[is] the intended realization (FVD-0135).
Where provision needed a joint section because abstract inputs had to be
#emph[reached] from raw ones, realization only has to #emph[deliver]
what the behavior produced.

#strong[Platform independence, as a theorem --- and its exact scope.]
Two realizations of one design --- PWM and I²C for the light ---
evaluate every pre-existing term alike
(`two_realizations_same_behavior`): the #emph[same formal evaluation]
(`MEv`) of every term that mentions neither fresh encoder, in either
lowered design, under the theorem's hypotheses (both encoder identities
fresh, inputs whose closures avoid them). That is the formal content of
"the behavior is independent of the mechanism"\; it says nothing about a
compiler, a backend, a board or a physical device, whose correctness is
the open codegen half (Part XI, FVI-0022). Only the command types and
traces differ (`exH`: duty 102 versus `(register 42, 40)` for the same
40 %). Independent realizations commute exactly, as environment equality
(`lower_comm`). Both device profiles are admissible for the light on the
Nano, and the PWM profile is not admissible for the relay --- the fit
fails, not the pins (`exH_admissible`). Admissibility is a conjunction
of three judgments that never see each other: the encoder's typing
`rep -> raw` under no grant, its fit, and Phase 7's solver on the
device's requirements (`Admissible`, `admissible_satisfiable`, FVD-0139
superseding FVD-0137, which had omitted the typing); the encoder knows
nothing about timers and the requirements nothing about brightness. The
gap is executed: an `Encoder` value whose term is `λn. true` fits the
light and allocates a PWM line and is not admissible (`exJ`,
`admissible_needs_wf`). A solvable board is not an electrically correct
device --- no voltage, current, thermal or timing property is proved
(Part XV).

#strong[Single driver stays what it was.] `SingleDriver` is about
logical outputs: at most one behavior declaration drives `o`. A device
that needs several pins --- PWM plus direction, SDA plus SCL, TX plus
enable --- is a requirement list at validation, not several drivers; and
a raw command may be structured --- the H-bridge encodes
`MotorSpeed = (forward?, magnitude)` to `(duty, direction)` with the
kernel's pairs (`exD_hbridge`), no record type needed. A device that
consumes several logical outputs at once is either several machine sinks
committed in the same tick --- the runtime already commits all outputs
of a domain together --- or one concept combined upstream, as Phase 6
places every combination of behaviors; the singleton realization is
primitive by #emph[decision] (FVD-0136) --- a decision supported by the
executed examples and the minimality argument, not a theorem that every
atomic multi-output protocol reduces to upstream combination or per-tick
batching (that question is FVI-0022) --- and the analogy with the shared
raw reading of Phase 13 fails for a stated reason: a reading physically
arrives as one image and its split is real, a frame is assembled by the
machine from values the behavior already produces separately.

#strong[Clocks.] The machine sink is in the output's clock and the
encoder with it; an encoder in another domain fails both `DriveWF` and
the domain judgment (`exI`). A device that consumes at another rate
needs an explicit `sync` in the lowered design --- Phase 5's transport,
never a resampling hidden in the binding --- and a peripheral's carrier
frequency (the PWM period, the bus clock) is device configuration for
validation, not a `ClockId` (FVD-0138).

#strong[Executed] (`Experiments/OutputRealizationExamples.lean`): the
GPIO identity on a relay; 8-bit PWM on the light with the driver
unchanged; the quantizing 4-bit PWM; a servo pulse `1000 + a·1000/180`
µs; the H-bridge pair; the misfits, the constructing encoder and the
impure encoder refused; PWM versus I²C for one light; the structural
theorems instantiated; both profiles admissible on the Nano and an
ill-typed encoder that fits and allocates but is not admissible; Model A
and the implicit clock crossing refuted.

#strong[What stays open] (FVI-0022): stateful output adapters ---
slew-rate limiting, dithering, batching, hysteresis --- and whether each
is the behavior's, a stateful lowering's with a stream-level theorem, or
the backend's; the device-clock variant; whether an #emph[atomic]
multi-value frame ever forces a many-to-one construction; the codegen
half --- abstract trace → raw command trace is proved, raw command trace
→ generated backend call is not (Part XI); and commitments on outputs,
which production does not author.

#strong[Production, at the snapshot] (read at `7a800bc`, where every
output-side crate and spec is identical to the `de8154f` snapshot).
`PhysicalOutput { accepts: SemanticId, clock, required }` is the logical
output; `DeviceBinding { kind, output, fixed_pins }` and
`bdl-hardware::devices` are the requirements half of a device profile
--- the kind is already deployment data, never on the output;
`bdl-lower` plans one output slot per validated edge at the
#emph[driver's] type, the generated core emits
`Outputs { output_n: Option<T> }`, and the spec says an output adapter
commits them. The encoder half does not exist: the value reaching the
adapter is the concept's representation, and the PWM/GPIO/I²C conversion
would be the adapter's, unchecked --- the same gap PRP-0001 named on the
Source side. No production record proposes the output side; the note
(`docs/notes/output-realization-by-device-encoders.md` § 5) records what
a consumer would need.

== Two remarks across Parts III--IX
<two-remarks-across-parts-iiiix>
=== Why the signature is a design object
<why-the-signature-is-a-design-object>
The most consequential decision in BDL is treating a declared
relationship as visible product intent. In programming, a signature is
often documentation and a static contract around code. In BDL it can
precede any code-like definition and remain useful on its own:
$? f : upright("Tilt") arrow.r upright("Brightness")$ says that the
designer has committed to a causal design relationship and to its
semantic boundary, and does not say how the mapping is computed. Clients
are typed against the type view and depend on the interface only through
it and through monotone evidence, so the partial commitment is not a
weaker form of a complete one. It is the form on which everything
downstream already rests.

=== Nominal identity in three places
<nominal-identity-in-three-places>
BDL makes the same choice three times. On the axis of quantity, `sem`
makes semantic identity nominal: two concepts of equal representation
are distinct, and moving between them is a declared relationship. On the
axis of time, `ClockId` makes temporal identity nominal: two domains of
equal rate are distinct, and moving between them is a `sync` with an
initial value. On the axis of effect, `OutputId` makes sink identity
nominal: two sinks of equal accepted type are distinct, and driving one
is an explicit edge. In each case the identity is independent of
representation, of rate, and of type respectively; in each case the
crossing is a visible artifact rather than a compiler action; and in
each case the alternative --- identity by representation, by rate, or by
type --- collided or was ambiguous for a mechanized reason. The three
are not all placed alike. Semantic identity is in the type, while clock
and sink identity are projections beside the interface checked by
separate global judgments, because putting the clock in the type forces
polymorphism on every pure mapping. Symmetry was not a design goal; it
is what remained.

= Part X --- Validation and Deployment
<part-x-validation-and-deployment>
A design that is typed, causal, clock-consistent and output-complete has
three more questions to answer before it runs on a product, and none of
them is a question about the design alone. Does it fit the chosen board?
Do its collections fit the memory and the schedule? And, once it is
compiled, does the code that runs behave as the model says? The formal
development answers the first two with decidable validation layers that
never touch the kernel, and leaves the third as a stated gap held closed
by testing. This Part is those three answers and the vocabulary that
keeps them apart.

The first two are monotone in the sense of Part III --- a refinement
preserves them --- and the third is not: six actuators fit a Nano and a
seventh, a monotone extension of the design, does not; a fast source
added to a slow consumer can exceed a window bound that was sufficient.
Deployability is evidence about a #emph[pair], re-solved from scratch,
and never merged with the evidence that survives refinement. Production
reports the two in different places --- the status line and the
inspector for the first two, the Deploy page for the third --- and words
them differently, so that a valid design is never mistaken for a
deployable one or the reverse (ADR-0006, ADR-0015 (FVD-0057, FVD-0062)).

== Target-specific hardware validation
<target-specific-hardware-validation>
Everything to this point is board-independent. A design that is typed,
causal, clock-consistent, and output-complete may still not fit the
microcontroller it is to run on, and that question is answered by a
validation layer that never touches the kernel.

=== Resources, capabilities, requirements
<resources-capabilities-requirements>
A target is a finite table. A #strong[resource] --- a pin --- has an
identity, a list of #strong[capabilities] from a shared vocabulary
(digital in/out, PWM, analog in, interrupt, the I2C, SPI, and UART
lines), and, per capability, the #strong[unit] backing it, such as the
timer behind a PWM pin or the peripheral behind a bus line. A
#strong[hardware description] is a list of resources with a
per-capability sharing policy: bus lines are shareable, everything else
is exclusive.

A design's needs are #strong[requirements]. Each has an identity, one
capability, an optional fixed resource for a manual pin choice, and an
optional membership in a group with a unit relation, #emph[same] or
#emph[distinct]:

$ upright("Requirement") = chevron.l thick & italic(i d)\,thick italic(c a p)\,\
 & italic(f i x e d) : upright("Option") thick upright("ResourceId")\,\
 & italic(g r o u p) : upright("Option") thick\(bb(N) times upright("UnitRel")\)thick chevron.r . $

Requirements are generated from the logical outputs of the previous
section by a #strong[device kind] (the requirements half of a device
profile; the encoder half is the realization section above): an H-bridge
channel needs a PWM line and a digital output; an I2C sensor needs SDA
and SCL on the same unit; a quadrature encoder needs two interrupt
lines. The pipeline is

$ upright("OutputId") arrow.r upright("DeviceKind") arrow.r upright("Requirements") arrow.r upright("solve") arrow.r upright("Assignment")\, $

and the sink never enumerates pins, so swapping the board is re-solving
the same requirements with the design untouched. Requirement identity is
independent of sink and declaration identity: one sink generates several
requirements, and two identical PWM needs must be two distinct
variables.

An #strong[assignment] is a list of requirement--resource pairs. It is
#strong[partially valid] when every entry is supported --- the resource
has the capability and any fixed choice is respected --- and every pair
is #strong[compatible]: two entries on the same resource must have the
same capability and it must be shareable, and two entries in the same
group must have equal units under #emph[same] and different units under
#emph[distinct]. It is #strong[valid for] a requirement list when
partially valid and covering exactly that list; the target is
#strong[satisfiable] when such an assignment exists.

=== A sound and complete solver
<a-sound-and-complete-solver>
Every constraint is unary or binary, so validity is prefix-closed, and
an exhaustive depth-first search that prunes on unary support and
pairwise compatibility with the current prefix is complete as well as
sound. Both are proved: if the solver returns an assignment it is valid
for the requirements, and if a valid assignment exists the solver
returns one. Feasibility of a finite instance is therefore decidable,
and the solver runs inside the proof checker by `decide`. The instance
is small enough that a general constraint solver @dechter2003constraint
is unnecessary; the claim is about this scope, not about embedded
allocation in general.

Extension of a target --- adding capabilities, units, or sharing to
existing resources --- preserves every valid assignment. Removing a
resource, adding or strengthening a requirement, or fixing a pin may
not.

=== Case study: an Arduino Nano
<case-study-an-arduino-nano>
The Arduino Nano's digital and analog pins are encoded as a table: PWM
on D3, D5, D6, D9, D10, and D11 backed by timers 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, and 2;
external interrupts on D2 and D3; I2C on A4 and A5. A design with four
H-bridge motor channels and one I2C inertial sensor is satisfiable, and
the solver's output is the assignment a tool would present:

```text
M1 -> D3 / D0     M2 -> D5 / D1
M3 -> D6 / D2     M4 -> D9 / D4
IMU -> A4 / A5
```

Two counterexamples fix the boundary between kernel and validation.
Seven independent PWM actuators pass every kernel condition --- globally
well formed, well clocked, causal, every drive edge well formed,
single-driver, output-complete --- and are unsatisfiable on the Nano,
which has six PWM pins. The same requirements are satisfiable on a
larger mock board with six more PWM pins on three more timers. Two
interrupt lines and six PWM lines meet every capability #emph[count]
exactly, two and six, and are unsatisfiable, because D3 is both the only
second interrupt pin and one of the six PWM pins. Capability counting is
not feasibility. Further examples establish that two PWM requirements
pinned to the same pin are rejected, that two I2C sensors on A4/A5 are
accepted since allocation is not all-different, that a manual pin choice
can turn a satisfiable design unsatisfiable while a consistent one is
honoured, that four PWM lines required on independent timers are
unsatisfiable on the Nano's three timers though six PWM pins exist, and
that TX and RX pinned to one UART unit stay together.

The explanation facility reports the first dead end under greedy
placement. For the seven-actuator design it names the seventh actuator
and, for each PWM pin, the actuator blocking it. This is #emph[a]
conflict under one placement order, not a minimal unsatisfiable core,
and it is meaningful only when the solver has already returned no
assignment.

=== Two kinds of evidence
<two-kinds-of-evidence>
Hardware feasibility is evidence about the pair (design, target), and it
is not monotone in the sense the preservation theorems require. Six
actuators are satisfiable; adding a seventh --- a monotone extension of
the design by a declaration and its sink --- is not. The distinction
drawn earlier between evidence that survives refinement and evidence
that is rechecked after every change is here concrete. Commitments
discharged compositionally survive $upright("EnvRefines")$\;
deployability on a target is re-solved; and the two are never merged.
This is why the workspace reports them as different states.

What the layer does not model should be stated as plainly. Voltage,
current, thermal budgets, memory, processor load, deadlines, bus
bandwidth, torque, travel, and PWM frequency values are outside it. Some
of these need summation constraints that are not binary, and while the
architecture leaves room for a compatibility predicate over sets,
nothing here establishes it. Units are one integer per capability per
resource, which models which timer or which UART but not timer modes.

== Deployment capacity
<deployment-capacity>
The third kind of validation evidence, added in Phase 9a, is deployment
capacity: whether every bounded collection in the design has a bound
sufficient for the target's memory and the schedule. Like feasibility
and unlike a commitment, it is not monotone --- adding a fast source to
a slow consumer can exceed a bound that was sufficient --- and it is
re-established after every change. Part VII gives the formal result
(`sufficient_capacity_preserves`, `periodic_capacity_sufficient`\;
#strong[formally proved]) and production's realization
(`bdl-exec-ir::bounds`, refusal at deploy; ADR-0027). The workspace
state #emph[hardware-feasible] of Part II is, in production, the
conjunction of allocation and capacity.

== Provision and realization as deployment architecture
<provision-and-realization-as-deployment-architecture>
Part IX's provision is a deployment construction: it takes the
executable design and a device profile per Source and yields another
design, provably an environment refinement of the first, in which every
abstract Source is a Value computed from a raw declaration. In the
deployment picture it sits between #emph[executable] and
#emph[deployable]: the provisioned design is what the platform adapter's
input slots feed and what the requirement generator sees, and
#emph[Fits] --- the concept's representation is the channel's --- is a
deployment check beside allocation and capacity. Nothing of this is
built at the snapshot (PRP-0001, ISS-0016); the placement is recorded so
that when it is built the transducer is a checked term in the deployment
pass and not host code in the adapter.

== The generated-code boundary
<the-generated-code-boundary>
Below deployability is one more boundary, and it is the weakest link in
the trust chain. The formal semantics is a tick-indexed relation;
production's reference evaluator is its executable transcription; the
generated `no_std` core (Part XI) is an implementation of that evaluator
which lowers representation --- dense slots, static structs, `f64`
fields, inlined lambdas --- and may not change meaning. The core is held
to the evaluator by a 22-case differential corpus, golden files, a
determinism check, property-generated designs and an error-tick
agreement check (#strong[production implemented and tested]). No theorem
relates the generated code to `Ev`/`MEv`, and none relates the static
list-bound analysis to the capacity theorems: a generated-code
refinement proof and a proved bound analysis are the open items that
would close the gap (Part XV). Differential tests are evidence for the
corpus; they are not a proof, and this document never infers formal
correctness of generated code from them.

== Open hardware questions
<open-hardware-questions>
The validation layer covers discrete pin and peripheral allocation with
unary and binary constraints, and the explanation facility reports a
first dead end under one placement order. What it does not cover is
stated once, in Part XV: minimal unsatisfiable cores; voltage, current,
thermal and timing budgets, which need summation constraints that are
not binary; timer modes and PWM frequency values; the device catalogue
that provision presupposes; and any board file beyond the Nano and the
larger mock board (an RP2040 file, runtime loading of
`hardware/boards/`, and the first platform adapter are production's
roadmap priorities, not records of anything that exists).

= Part XI --- Production Compiler, Runtime and Daemon
<part-xi-production-compiler-runtime-and-daemon>
`KCN-judu/BDL` is the engineering implementation of the language whose
kernel was derived in `BDL_FV`. It builds what the formal development
deliberately did not: the elaborator, the tooling and the execution
path. It follows the formally developed semantics and is not itself
formally verified. One property the whole system is built to keep
obvious: #emph[BDL semantics flows downward; implementation mechanisms
never flow upward and redefine the language.] This Part describes the
architecture at the production snapshot (`de8154f`, Appendix F) in
enough detail to be a reference for it.

== Four trust layers

  , kind: table
  )

Studio may render an edit optimistically, but the truth comes back from
the compiler as a #emph[projection]\; Studio never holds a second copy
of the language (ADR-0001). `bdld` is a process boundary (ADR-0002),
speaking protobuf over framed stdio (ADR-0007), with one canonical
revision stream per opened project.

== Crates and semantic ownership
<crates-and-semantic-ownership>
The dependency direction is strict and acyclic:
`model → ir → {syntax → elab, check → equations → elab, check → reactive → output} → compiler → ide-db → ide → {lsp, daemon}`\;
`protocol` sits between `compiler` and `daemon`\; `text` and `layout`
hang off `system` and are joined by `daemon`, `lsp` and the CLI;
`hardware` depends on `model` only --- it never sees `Δ` --- and
`compiler` joins the two; `lower → codegen` hang off `exec-ir`\;
`runtime-core` depends on nothing and is what generated code links
against. A crate exists only where a real boundary exists.

Planned and designed but not implemented: `bdl-component` (supplied Rust
component contracts; "supplied Rust cannot drive outputs", ADR-0005) and
`bdl-runtime-embassy` (the first platform adapter).

== The compiler as a pipeline of explicit passes
<the-compiler-as-a-pipeline-of-explicit-passes>
```
load/parse → identity resolution → signature resolution → surface elaboration
→ type checking → semantic-construction (grant) checking → dimension checking
→ dependency analysis → causality → clock domains → physical outputs
→ hardware requirement generation → hardware allocation → reactive lowering
→ Rust code generation
```

Each pass has an explicit input and output type and is pure where
practical (`docs/architecture/compiler-pipeline.md`). Diagnostics are
first-class outputs: an incomplete project is the normal case, never a
fail-fast, which is the engineering face of the signature-first
position. `apply_edit` classifies every operation as a #emph[refinement]
(dependents' established facts remain valid) or an #emph[edit]
(dependents must be re-validated) and reports an explicit `Invalidation`
set ---
`Interface | Realization | Semantic | Reactive | Clock | Output | Deployment`
--- with the originating declarations (ADR-0009); incremental analysis
subscribes to these categories, so the refinement-versus-edit
distinction of Part III is an engineering asset, not folklore.

Numerics are IEEE `f64` (ADR-0011), a recorded deviation from the
kernel's `Nat`: division by an exact zero and any non-finite result fail
the tick with a structured error, equality is exact, and the production
numerics are not what the formal theorems are about (Part XIII).

#strong[Formula elaboration] (ADR-0013, extended by ADR-0025): a
designer-facing formula language --- `+ − * / < <= > >= == != && || !`,
`if`, `match` over Bool/Option/numbers/counts, `let`, calls, list and
pair literals, rules `x => …` as equation arguments, membership
`x in […]`, the slot `?` --- parsed by a hand-written Pratt parser into
a surface AST that is never reused as Core. Input names are the
concepts' display names, re-resolved on every analysis; inputs appear as
their representations (`rep (var i)`) and the whole formula is wrapped
in `mk B` under the declaration's own grant --- the elaborator never
emits `mk` of any other concept, and the checker refuses one anyway.
Units elaborate through the registry; equations are matched and inlined
at the use; `bdl-check` re-derives the Core term's type and is the
authority.

== Executable IR and lowering
<executable-ir-and-lowering>
`bdl-exec-ir` is a first-order IR with dense slots: clock slots, state
cells addressed by `StateCellId { decl, path }` (the declaration and the
expression path of the `delay`/`sync` inside its realization, so
identity survives unrelated edits), input slots for unresolved
declarations, output plans with their driver. Lambdas and applications
are inlined as `Let` bindings; the recursor becomes
`Fold { elem, acc, step, init, list }` with one closure per recursor
applied by the runtime --- never a closure #emph[value]\; `rep`/`mk`
become `Unwrap`/`Wrap` on a per-concept newtype. Lowering fixes an
evaluation order from the plan; the reference evaluator's own tests show
its result is independent of the host's processing order and the
generated program's traces equal the reference's.

== The generated core
<the-generated-core>
```rust
pub const DESIGN: &str; pub const HAS_DOMAINS: bool; pub const CLOCK_COUNT: u16;
pub const CLOCK_k: ClockSlot;
pub struct SemN(pub Repr);                       // one per concept carried
pub struct Cells { pub cell_k: Option<T>, … }    // temporal state, None until first written
pub struct State { pub cells: Cells }
pub struct Inputs { pub decl_n: Option<T>, … }   // unresolved declarations
pub struct Values { pub decl_n: Option<T>, … }   // every declaration, None when not due
pub struct Outputs { pub output_n: Option<T>, … }
pub struct Tick { pub values: Values, pub outputs: Outputs }
pub fn init() -> State;
pub fn step(state: &mut State, active: ActiveDomains, inputs: &Inputs) -> Result<Tick, RuntimeError>;
```

A program without lists is `Copy`, statically sized, laid out by the
compiler: no graph, no map, no allocation, no traversal at runtime.
Types: `q d → f64` (the dimension is static and in the manifest),
`bool`, `nat → u64`, `sem s → SemN`, `opt τ → Option<T>`,
`list τ → Vec<T>` (last element first), `τ × σ → (T, S)`\; a function
type has no runtime representation. Symbols derive from stable ids
(`decl_17`, `Sem3`, `cell_0`), never from display names. The core is
`#![no_std] #![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and mentions no HAL, pin,
peripheral or board; `cargo check --lib` of every corpus crate is a
test.

== Embedded execution model
<embedded-execution-model>
The formal semantics is a tick-indexed relation; production gives it a
deterministic step function per domain and states what the generated
core must preserve (`docs/spec/runtime-semantics.md`):

- #strong[Declarations are not tasks] (ADR-0004). Never one async task
  per declaration. Per clock domain, one deterministic
  `step(prev_state, inputs) → (next_state, outputs)`: hardware timer or
  interrupt → activate domain `c` → step → publish `c`'s snapshot →
  commit the physical outputs owned by `c`. Meaning never depends on
  executor task order.
- #strong[Two phases.] #emph[Read]: every declaration due this tick is
  evaluated (lazily, memoized) with temporal forms yielding their cell's
  committed value, or the initial value if the cell was never written.
  #emph[Write]: every temporal site whose writing domain is active ---
  the owner's domain for `delay`, `src` for `sync` --- evaluates its
  operand in the same read mode into the #emph[next] state. Nothing is
  updated in place; reads never see writes of the same tick.
- #strong[Previous/next state.] `step` reads only `prev`, writes only
  `next`, and assigns at the end --- not at all on error. Every delay
  carries its explicit initial value; a cell is `Option<T>`, `None`
  until first written; there is no implicit zero.
- #strong[The sync snapshot rule.] `sync src init e` reads the last
  committed snapshot of `src` from an activation strictly before the
  current tick, `init` if there was none, and never invokes `step_src`
  recursively. When two domains are ready at the same instant, each
  observes only the other's previously committed activation --- the
  scheduler's order is unobservable, exactly as in the formal model
  (`scheduling_order_observable` is the counterexample for the
  alternative). In generated code a `sync` cell's writer is the
  #emph[source] domain's slot.
- #strong[Output commit timing.] Outputs are built after the write phase
  from the driving declarations' values (`output_values`), and committed
  by the domain that owns the sink.
- #strong[Allocator requirements.] A core that carries a list needs a
  global allocator (ADR-0024); the manifest records
  `requires_allocator`, per-cell bounds, `state_bytes_max` and
  `tick_bytes_max`\; the first platform adapter is to declare an arena
  sized from the manifest and state the most it supplies for each list
  input.
- #strong[Collection bounds.] Static, sound per declaration and cell
  (`bdl-exec-ir::bounds`); the window capacity model per crossing;
  refusal of an unbounded state on a bounded-memory target (ADR-0027,
  Part VII).
- #strong[Cost discipline.] Moves, not clones: a use analysis per
  expression tree moves a local referenced once in its scope, clones any
  other reference, and always clones a local captured by a fold's
  closure, so a fold step that `cons`es onto its accumulator moves it
  --- `map`, `filter`, `append`, `sum`, `any`, `all`, `contains` clone
  nothing per element (clone-counting tests; measured ×15 for 2 000 → 32
  000 elements). A total conditional --- neither branch can fail --- is
  emitted as a Rust `if`, observationally the strict `ite`\; a branch
  that can fail keeps `prim::ite` and its strictness. Borrowed reads for
  `length`, `head`, `take`, `==`, `<`. Commit-only writes: a tick clones
  no cell it does not read. What remains: `zip` clones its accumulator
  pair per element (ISS-0013); no fusion of `map → filter` chains,
  because each is linear and measured and a fused emission was not
  justified by the numbers.
- #strong[The realization boundary.] A source (an unresolved unit-domain
  declaration) is an #emph[input slot] of `step`, filled by the adapter
  from a sensor, a bus or a simulation trace; a driven output is an
  #emph[output field] of the step's result, committed by the adapter to
  GPIO or PWM. Neither is a function call inside the core: a zero-input
  relationship compiles to a zero-argument accessor of the committed
  value (its unit argument erased, ADR-0029), and a sink is a field, not
  an `A -> ()` callback (Part IX). The core therefore has no device
  vocabulary at all.
- #strong[Targets.] The core is target-independent. macOS and Windows
  are first-class hosts for the toolchain; no platform adapter exists at
  the snapshot --- Embassy is roadmap priority 1; an RP2040 board file
  is not yet present.

Current cost figures are recorded, not optimized: a lamp core is \~95
lines and \~7 KB of source with a zero-byte `State`\; the collections
and buffer corpus cases allocate and their debug-build timings are two
orders of magnitude above the allocation-free cases --- a baseline for
later evaluation, nothing more.

== Differential testing
<differential-testing>
For the same design, schedule and input trace, the reference evaluator
and the generated program must agree value by value, tick by tick
(`crates/bdl-compiler/tests/backend_*.rs`). The corpus: lamp and
lamp-with-output, pure arithmetic with dimensions and a count,
collections (`any`, `sum`, `map`, `filter`, `zip`, `contains`, `clamp`,
`getOrElse`/`head`, structural equality, a list in a state cell),
`buffer` (the Phase-9a window as five declarations), `bounded_buffer`
and `overflowing_buffer`, semantic `rep`/`mk` with a Boolean concept,
booleans/comparisons/strict `if`/options, `delay`, a cycle broken by
`delay`, `sync` across two domains in both directions with the slow
domain on period 2, a domain-agnostic declaration shared by two domains,
division by zero, non-finite result, missing input, a design with no
domain --- 22 cases, each generated, `cargo check`ed as a `no_std`
library, built with its bridge, run and compared, with golden files
pinning the generated bytes and a determinism check that generating
twice gives identical output; a 3 000-tick run; property-based
generation of designs (250 per run in process, a seeded batch of 8
through the full toolchain); and the storage-order audit of the reversed
`Vec`. Comparison is exact (`f64` bit-for-bit in effect; the generated
code performs the same IEEE operations in the same order --- no
reassociation, fusion or CSE --- and the JSON transport is exact);
errors must fail at the same tick with a failure the reference could
report, computed by starting the reference's traversal at every due
declaration.

== Project persistence and the daemon
<project-persistence-and-the-daemon>
A project is one directory (ADR-0023, superseding ADR-0020's third
project #emph[kind]): `bdl.toml` (name, schema, compiler version --- no
kind), `src/**/*.bdl` (the authored design and system --- the semantic
source), `.bdl/identities.json` (source key → stable id, allocators, the
flat-id freshening table --- tool-owned), `.bdl/authoring.json`
(behavior groups by identity), `ui/layout.json` (positions, viewports,
group boxes --- presentation). "Source of truth" is a per-fact
statement: the semantic model never depends on geometry, the graph never
stores a semantic fact, the text never stores a position; erasing both
sidecars and the layout changes no semantic fact; erasing the sources
loses the design. A legacy JSON project is migrated in place the first
time it is opened, identities and layout kept.

`bdld`'s coordinator is the single imperative loop: it owns the
`Session`, applies edits serially through the pure `apply_edit`, and
hands immutable snapshots to analyses. Every semantic edit is sent
against the revision Studio holds and refused if the project has moved
on; every response and event carries its revision; revisions are
strictly monotone (undo produces a new revision), so staleness is a `<`
comparison. Overlays --- a definition draft per mapping, a text document
per file --- never create a revision; `AnalysisSnapshot` composes
committed + overlays, runs `analyze`, and is stamped
`(revision, generation)`\; a query holding an old snapshot keeps seeing
the world it started in.

== The IDE service, the daemon and the protocol
<the-ide-service-the-daemon-and-the-protocol>
Studio (visual) and text editors (textual) are two projections of one
semantic model and consume one service. `bdl-ide-db` holds the ground
state --- the committed snapshot plus overlays for unsaved drafts and
text buffers --- and produces immutable, stamped `AnalysisSnapshot`s;
`bdl-ide` answers diagnostics, hover and Explain, scope-aware
completion, definition/references/rename across files, semantic actions
and edit plans, invalidation previews, symbols, semantic tokens and the
Formula Composer's three queries, all in BDL-owned types keyed by
`EntityRef` and role --- never by text position or node id; `bdl-lsp`
and `bdld` are thin adapters at the edge (ADR-0017). The daemon speaks a
typed, versioned protobuf protocol over framed stdio (ADR-0002,
ADR-0007). Every semantic edit is sent against the revision the client
holds and refused if the project has moved on; every response carries
its revision; revisions are strictly monotone, so staleness is a `<`
comparison (ADR-0009). Protocol versions are additive within a minor
series and volatile: the version at the snapshot and what each recent
minor added are in Appendix F, not here.

#strong[Incremental invalidation.] `apply_edit` classifies every
operation as a refinement or an edit and reports an `Invalidation` set
---
`Interface | Realization | Semantic | Reactive | Clock | Output | Deployment`
--- with the originating declarations. That is the
refinement-versus-edit distinction of Part III as an engineering asset:
what is re-analysed after an edit is decided by a model of which
established facts an edit can disturb, not by folklore. A proved
per-category preservation theorem does not exist (Part XV).

#strong[One classifier for text.] Highlighting looks lexical and is not:
whether `tilt` is a Source or a Value, whether `deg` is a unit or a
parameter, whether `all` is a binder word here, whether `clamp` is the
library's --- each is a fact of the snapshot, the same fact that drives
hover, Explain, completion and the canvas. So there is one classifier,
`bdl-ide::tokens`: a lexical layer from the lossless syntax tree (total
on any text, so a file mid-edit keeps its reading) merged with a
semantic layer from the snapshot's projections and the derived role,
into one sorted, disjoint stream of byte-range tokens. Its vocabulary is
the LSP semantic-token vocabulary --- the standard types and modifiers,
themed by every LSP editor without configuration --- plus two BDL
additions, `unit` and `slot`, with BDL's distinctions expressed as
#emph[modifiers] on standard types (a Source is `variable` + `source`),
under a versioned legend. The language server encodes the stream as
`textDocument/semanticTokens` in the client's position encoding through
a pure encoder for UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32; the daemon sends the same
stream structured to Studio; conversion between the two is lossless and
lives in `bdl-ide`. No Dart, TypeScript or grammar file decides a class;
no colour crosses a boundary (ADR-0035). The rule is the one ADR-0001
sets for semantics generally --- Rust classifies, clients render ---
applied to the one place a client would most naturally have kept its own
copy of the language.

== The elaboration passes the kernel implies
<the-elaboration-passes-the-kernel-implies>
The surface editor and kernel are connected by an elaboration function
from surface designs to kernel environments with diagnostics. These
passes were stated in the formal development before any elaborator
existed; the production pipeline above realizes them --- resolution and
formula elaboration in `bdl-elab`, temporal lowering and domain
assignment in `bdl-lower` and `bdl-reactive`, output binding in
`bdl-output`, hardware validation in `bdl-hardware`, normalization and
erasure in `bdl-exec-ir` and `bdl-codegen-rust`. The list is kept
because it is the specification those crates were written to, and
because it says what each pass may and may not consult.

#strong[Name and signature resolution.] Resolve concepts to identities,
Mapping signatures to declaration interfaces, contexts, device kinds,
units, and imported components. At this stage an unresolved
`Tilt -> Brightness` mapping already has a stable identity and an
expected type, and every reference to it is typed.

#strong[Formula elaboration.] For each Mapping with a definition, check
the definition against the declared codomain under the grant of the
declaration's own signature. A scalar formula attached to a `Brightness`
output elaborates to $upright("mk")_(upright("Brightness"))\(dots.h\)$
because the surrounding signature announces the concept; the constructor
is inserted by the elaborator and is legal only there. Units elaborate
to scaled dimensioned literals. Curve, example, and component
definitions elaborate to the same realization form.

#strong[Temporal lowering.] Surface temporal phrases lower to the
declaration shapes of the derived-operator table. A context lowers to an
activation declaration, an entry declaration, gated and reset local
state, and a conditional in each output's driver. A reusable stateful
component is instantiated into fresh declarations at each use, because
temporal state cannot occur under a binder.

#strong[Domain assignment.] Domains are declared, so this pass records
the clock environment and checks the domain judgment. A reference across
domains without a transport is reported at the reference, in the
designer's names for the two domains, with the two legitimate
resolutions --- transport the value with a stated initial value, or move
the reader to the source's domain --- stated in terms of their
behavioral consequence.

#strong[Output binding.] Record the drive edges and check type and clock
equality, single-driver, and, for executable designs, completeness.
Where several contexts would drive one output, the elaborator emits one
driver whose body selects among them; the selection is visible in the
elaborated design.

#strong[Hardware validation.] Generate requirements from device kinds,
run the solver against the selected target, and attach the assignment or
the explanation to the bindings.

#strong[Normalization and erasure.] After checking is complete, semantic
identities, dimensions, and domains carry no computational content and
may be erased; erasure is proved sound for identities and for
dimensions. Nominal wrappers introduced by elaboration cancel,
$upright("rep")\(upright("mk")_s thick e\)arrow.r.squiggly e$, and the
flattened program is checked under the universal grant because every
construction was authorized at its declaration. Unfolding all
realizations into a closed term preserves typing on the delay-free
fragment and agrees with tick-by-tick evaluation on first-order designs;
the higher-order case holds up to closure equivalence and was not
formalized. Erasure is applied selectively at boundaries the checker
cannot see through --- supplied blocks, device bindings, the public
interface of generated code --- where wrappers are retained so that the
host compiler continues to check what BDL cannot.

The kernel never depends on normalization to decide type equality; it is
not dependently typed, and normalization is an analysis and
code-generation instrument. Floating-point arithmetic is not
associative, so any symbolic normalization over the reals must record
the resulting numerical deviation as an obligation rather than silently
altering the property being checked.

= Part XII --- Studio and the IDE: The User Interface as a Semantic Projection
<part-xii-studio-and-the-ide-the-user-interface-as-a-semantic-projection>
Studio is not a drawing tool with a compiler attached; it is a set of
projections of the compiler's verdicts, arranged so that semantic
distinctions become interaction distinctions and nothing else does. This
Part describes the interaction model as designed and, at the snapshot,
largely built (`docs/architecture/studio-ui.md`\; what remains is in
Appendix F). Whether the model is #emph[usable] is an empirical question
no study has yet answered (Part XV).

== Three information levels
<three-information-levels>
Every semantic fact is designed for exactly one primary level and may
echo at the next only as detail behind the first (ADR-0018):

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (25%, 25%, 25%, 25%),
    align: (auto,auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([level], [answers], [may use], [may not use],),
    table.hline(),
    [1 Canvas], [what does the product do; what depends on what; what is
    still open; where does behavior become physical], [object
    silhouette, socket shape, socket hue, links, grouping, containment,
    line style, the object's own state; one state word where
    unavoidable], [type labels, ids, compiler words, badges, counts],
    [2 Inspector], [what does the selected object mean; what can I
    change; what will the change affect], [designer vocabulary:
    #emph[Meaning, Value, Unit, Reads, Produces, Relationship, Used by,
    affects, checked again]\; diagnostics in product language attached
    to the field they concern], [`SemanticId`, `DeclId`, `Ty`, `Grant`,
    `realization`, `Clocked`, `SingleDriver`, solver, protocol,
    revision, enum names],
    [3 Explain], [why was this accepted or refused; what did the surface
    form elaborate into; which rule applies], [all of the above, kernel
    notation, Core IR, diagnostic codes, revision], [---],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Explain is one collapsed disclosure at the end of the inspector, never
open by default; nothing in levels 1--2 depends on it. This is the
progressive-disclosure claim of Part I made operational: the kernel is
reachable, and it is never in the way.

== The canvas
<the-canvas>
#strong[Socket hue = semantic identity.] In a node editor a socket's
colour is its data type; in BDL the type that matters is the nominal
concept, so each concept gets a stable hue derived from its `SemanticId`
--- deterministic, never from the name, with lightness chosen per hue so
every identity clears 3:1 contrast in both appearances. A link is
accepted only between sockets of the same concept: while a link is
dragged every compatible socket gains a faint halo, the one under the
pointer a strong halo, and an incompatible socket shows the forbidden
cursor. The canvas shows the nominal typing rule without a diagnostic.
Tilt and MotorAngle, both angles, have two hues and never connect.

#strong[Socket shape = value form.] Quantity ○, on--off ◇, count □,
collection ⧉ (a stack), grouped value ▯ (a split square), optional value
◎ (a ring with a hole); a concept whose value form is not yet chosen is
a hollow ring. The same glyph, drawn by the same code, appears in the
library, in chips, toggles and pop-ups. No type words are written beside
a socket anywhere.

#strong[Unresolved state.] A declared rule --- realization `none` with
inputs --- is drawn with a dashed outline, an empty definition region
and the one word #emph[declared]\; dashed survives selection; never red.
A Source --- realization `none` on the unit domain --- is #emph[not]
dashed: it is complete, and it is drawn as the next section says. A
definition the compiler cannot accept gets a red mark at the definition
line, where the problem lives, and no word in the header. A relationship
waiting on a concept whose value form is not chosen is a solid node
whose read socket is hollow, with the inspector saying #emph[checked
once Temperature's value is decided]. These are the states of Part II's
table, drawn.

#strong[What the canvas never means.] Edges are dependency, not
execution order; drawing order does not set output priority; node
position is layout only (ADR-0003) --- an entity without a position is
placed by the daemon's layout service on open and on commit,
deterministically, without moving anything placed, and Studio arranges
nothing at render time. No node type exists per arithmetic operator:
formulas live in the inspector. Dragging a node over a link does not
auto-insert it, because links are typed by concept and silent insertion
would be a semantic edit.

#strong[Header colour = category]: concept, mapping, context, output,
transport --- muted; identity hues are the only saturated marks on the
canvas. Interaction follows Blender's node editor conventions; a concept
in use cannot be deleted without the banner naming its dependents.

== Source, Rule and Value on the canvas
<source-rule-and-value-on-the-canvas>
The three roles of Part IX are the canvas's first distinction, drawn
without colour alone. A #strong[Source] has no input socket and one
output socket, never a `()` port; its header carries the word
#emph[Source], an entry glyph --- an arrow crossing a boundary tick ---
and a solid bar on the node's #strong[left] edge, the environment side,
the mirror of a sink's bar on the right, with a green header strip as
the redundant cue. It is not dashed: nothing is missing. Assistive
technology hears #emph[name, Source: a value entering the behavior model
from the environment, provides C]. A #strong[Rule] wears the word
#emph[rule]\; when nothing applies it, its output socket is hollow and
the header says #emph[not applied]. A #strong[Value] is the plain node.
The inspector says what an object #emph[is], not what it lacks: a
Source's Meaning section has #emph[Role: Source] with one sentence, its
output section is #emph[Provides] (a relationship's is #emph[Produces]),
and its Relationship section opens with #emph[Realization: provided by
the environment; no device is bound yet] --- never #emph[calls],
#emph[reads hardware] or #emph[sensor]. Hover and Explain speak the
formal vocabulary: `role: Source`, `type: () -> C`, definition
#emph[none --- provided by the environment, observed once per
activation]\; a resolved `() -> A` cites `resolved_not_source`.

#strong[Edges.] A #strong[signature edge] runs socket to socket and is
the interface; a #strong[reference edge] is a thin neutral line into a
relationship's formula line for every relationship the formula names,
drawn from `MappingAnalysis.references` --- the kernel's `DependsOn` by
identity --- never from a reading of the formula text, not editable, not
a drop target (ADR-0034 (FVD-0005)). #emph[Produces] is the signature;
#emph[carried by], in the Simulate probe, is a value per tick. Studio
consumes `references` and `applied_by` and never inverts or scans
anything.

== Semantic actions
<semantic-actions>
A finding may carry a #strong[fix], and a fix is a semantic action the
IDE service plans and the daemon applies as an ordinary edit: #emph[Make
empty domain explicit] on the legacy shorthand, #emph[Insert explicit
sync] at a cross-domain reference, and #emph[Add a value that applies X]
(`rule.apply`) on a rule nothing applies --- ready when each read
concept has exactly one producing value, a choice when one has several,
blocked with the reason when one has none or the arguments update in two
timing domains; blocked, with the instance named, for a rule inside an
instance, because the value belongs in the component's source. Actions
and entity hover are requested in the system context only, on the flat
entities. A fix chosen on the Simulate page selects the object, asks for
its actions and applies the one of that kind when it arrives ready. The
tool never guesses.

== Colour in the Code view and the formula field
<colour-in-the-code-view-and-the-formula-field>
The Code view and the definition editor's text field colour BDL text by
the IDE service's semantic tokens (Part XI): one request per text shown
and per pause in typing, the spans of the unchanged prefix and suffix
shifted while a keystroke's answer is on its way, and never a stale span
over changed text; only the latest generation's answer lands. Studio's
`SyntaxTheme` maps the token #emph[names] to styles in the canvas's own
category encoding; Studio classifies no BDL syntax itself (ADR-0035).
This is the broader architectural rule made visible at the character
level: semantic authority stays in Rust, and clients render projections.

== The Library
<the-library>
The Library tab lists the Standard Library's items in two sections,
#emph[Concepts] and #emph[Sources], with names and search localized by
id through Studio's ordinary localization pipeline. Inserting an item is
one request (`InstantiateLibraryItem`) the daemon plans as a fragment of
ordinary objects and applies in one transaction --- every step or none,
one revision, one Undo --- and the canvas draws what was created exactly
as it draws what was made by hand: a Source item's relationship is a
Source by the derived rule, not by a flag. The Library is an authoring
catalogue; it says nothing about devices.

== Groups and components on one canvas
<groups-and-components-on-one-canvas>
A behavior system has three zoom levels on one canvas: the system of
instances, an instance's body, and the flat design. A group is a box
that can be collapsed to its aggregate sockets (`crossIn ++ openMembers`
in, `crossOut` out --- Part VIII), moved, merged and split with no
revision and no re-check; #emph[Package as Component] opens a sheet that
shows the inferred required, provided and private members and lets the
designer widen but not narrow them. An instance node shows its required
and provided ports with the same socket glyphs; a component's body is
edited in its own scope with its own drafts and completion. The
packaging sheet teaches by showing: the boundary the designer sees on
the collapsed group is exactly the interface the component receives.

== Design, Code and Split: views of one project
<design-code-and-split-views-of-one-project>
The same open project is shown as a graphical behavior model, as its
source files, or both side by side (ADR-0023). Switching is a view
change --- no conversion, import, export or project type. Graph → text:
a canvas operation is a semantic edit on the model, and the textual
projection is the minimal item-level splice of the sources, keeping
comments and formatting outside the touched item; computed for the Code
view on request and written on save. Text → graph: a Code-view edit is
the whole text of one file against a revision; if it builds,
declarations are bound to their identities by reconciliation (retained,
allocated, dropped, renamed, ambiguous, duplicate) and the project moves
to a new revision; if not, the committed project stays and the draft is
held with the loader's faults --- malformed text never erases the graph.
An entity authored first in Code and one authored first in Design are
indistinguishable once synchronised. The Code pane shows an out-of-step
banner with the daemon's reasons and syncs selection in Split.

Ownership boundaries, stated once and relied on everywhere: source
semantics in `src/**/*.bdl`\; identity in `.bdl/identities.json`\;
authoring metadata (groups) in `.bdl/authoring.json`\; layout in
`ui/layout.json`\; viewport and session state in the running Studio
only. Studio state is three things kept apart --- semantic projection
(owned by the compiler, only rendered), editor state (selection, open
inspector, pending requests), rendering state (drag position, hover,
zoom, never persisted or sent).

== The definition editor and the Formula Composer
<the-definition-editor-and-the-formula-composer>
The definition editor has two projections of one draft, chosen with a
#strong[Formula | Text] control (ADR-0028). The Text view is a field
over the compiler's verdict, with completion, hover and fixes from the
IDE service. The Formula view draws the compiler's `FormulaProjection`
as the expression it is --- `clamp( [Tilt] ÷ [90][deg ▾], [0], [1] )`
--- never as a graph inside the node.

#strong[Architecture.] The draft text of a mapping's definition is an
overlay in the IDE host (`MappingDefinitionDraft`), never a revision;
`bdl-ide::formula` builds the projection from the #emph[effective]
definition text on every request and never stores it:

```
FormulaProjection   formula_projection(&snapshot, mapping)
                    = trace_formula_in (bdl-elab: the surface tree and the type of every
                      sub-expression, on success and on failure)
                    → FormulaNode tree: tree-path ids, byte ranges, kinds, actual types,
                      expected types by local dimension inference (solve),
                      diagnostics placed on the innermost node, the slots in source order
SlotInfo            formula_slot(&snapshot, mapping, node)
                    = the projection's expectation at `node` + units_for(dim)
                      + reference candidates by type + equations by scheme match and capability
ComposeResult       compose(&snapshot, mapping, source, ComposeOp)
                    = the text a structured action makes: byte-range edits of the draft,
                      parenthesised by precedence, a unit switched with the value kept
```

`FormulaTrace` is the elaborator's typing trace, kept on success and on
failure, so a formula that does not check still has a projection for the
parts that do. A `FormulaNode` carries its #emph[actual] type (what the
sub-expression is) and its #emph[expected] type (what its position
demands, by `solve`), and node identity is the tree path --- ephemeral,
stable within one draft generation, not an entity, never in
`.bdl/identities.json`. `bdld` carries the projection with every
`DefinitionDraftAnalysis` (one round trip per keystroke, the same
generation) and answers `GetFormulaProjection` (the committed
definition, no overlay), `GetFormulaSlot` and `ComposeFormula` (protocol
0.12).

#strong[Every structured action is a text edit.] `compose` answers a
`ComposeOp` --- fill a slot, wrap in an operator, call an equation with
the component as first argument, set a literal's unit, set a literal's
coordinate, remove --- with byte-range edits of the draft and the whole
new source; Studio puts it into the draft through the ordinary
`DefinitionDraftChanged`, and the ordinary analysis follows. One commit
path, one conflict model, one set of diagnostics. Studio stores the
mode, the selection and the open pop-up --- never a parsed tree, an
inferred dimension or a unit rule; building the tree in Dart was
rejected because precedence, parenthesization and unit conversion would
move into Studio (ADR-0001).

#strong[Encodings.] A #emph[slot] is a dashed hollow chip (dashed = not
decided, as the canvas's #emph[declared] node); a #emph[reference] is a
chip with its concept's socket glyph; a #emph[literal] is two fields,
the coordinate and a unit pop-up listing the compiler's units for the
literal's own dimension, where the pop-up switches the unit and keeps
the quantity and the coordinate field makes a new quantity in the same
unit --- only a literal has a unit pop-up (Part VI); #emph[operators]
are their glyphs, a #emph[call] its name and parentheses, `and` / `or` /
`not` their words, a #emph[choice] `if` with its condition over indented
`then` / `else` branches (with true / false buttons and truth-valued
references offered on a slot that expects true or false), a
#emph[binder] a head over an indented body with italic local chips, a
#emph[range] two ends around `..`, and an #emph[opaque form] (`let`,
`match`, a block, a rule as an argument, a collection or grouped
literal, `delay`/`sync`) its text in monospace, selectable and edited as
text. A finding is a red underline on the component #emph[and] its row
under the field --- one diagnostic, two projections. Beneath the field,
for the selected component: the compiler's sentence --- #emph[Expected:
an angle, because an angle ÷ an angle = a dimensionless quantity] ---
with the kernel's notation behind Explain; for a slot, a number entry
whose unit pop-up holds the units of the expected dimension (none for a
dimensionless slot; none, with a sentence, when the position is not
determined), then references by type and equations folded; for a
component, `+ − × ÷`, Compare, Function (the equations whose result
fits, wrapping the component as first argument) and Remove.

#strong[Stale projection policy.] A projection is current only when it
is of exactly the text on screen and that text parsed; otherwise the
field is dimmed with a notice --- #emph[Waiting for the compiler to read
the formula…] while the verdict for this text is on its way, #emph[The
text cannot be read as a formula.] when it never will be, and then no
tree is shown because none is invented --- no component answers a click,
no slot panel opens, no key acts, the reducer refuses a structured
action (or a second one in flight) and discards an answer for text that
has moved on; #strong[Edit as text] is the way out. Generation safety:
every answer carries the draft generation it was computed for and is
discarded if the draft has moved. A formula with a slot may be saved and
is #emph[invalid] until filled; commit, revert, conflict and detach are
the Text view's, unchanged.

#strong[A walkthrough.] The designer selects
`dimByTilt : Tilt → Brightness` and chooses Function → `clamp`\; the
draft becomes `clamp(?, ?, ?)`, three dashed slots. Selecting the first,
the slot panel says #emph[Expected: a dimensionless quantity] ---
because `clamp`'s scheme unifies all three arguments with the result and
the result is Brightness's representation --- and lists references of
that kind; the designer chooses `tilt`, and the compiler answers
#emph[This is an angle; a dimensionless quantity is expected], red on
the chip. Wrapping it in `÷` yields `clamp(tilt ÷ ?, ?, ?)`\; the new
slot's panel now says #emph[Expected: an angle, because an angle ÷ an
angle = a dimensionless quantity] and offers `rad`, `deg`, `turn`\; the
designer types 90 and picks `deg`. Filling `0` and `1` completes
`clamp(tilt / 90 deg, 0, 1)`, which checks, and the node's red mark
goes. Switching the `deg` pop-up to `rad` rewrites the literal to
`1.5707963267948966 rad` and nothing else. Every step was a byte-range
edit of one text; the Text view shows the same characters throughout.

== Partial expressions: `?`
<partial-expressions>
The slot deserves its own record because it is the clearest example in
BDL of authoring semantics distinct from runtime semantics. `?` is a
`SlotExpr` of the textual grammar: it parses wherever a value may stand
and formats as itself; it is never a value, an operator or a unit
(`1 ? 2` is a syntax error). It exists in the #emph[surface] because an
incomplete structured formula must be ordinary draft text --- the same
state as any unfinished draft, savable, visible in the Text view,
subject to the same conflict model --- rather than a second
representation held in an overlay of partial expressions (the rejected
alternative, which would have needed its own persistence and its own
protocol of operations). Elaboration refuses it with
`formula.slot.empty` --- #emph[This slot is empty; it expects an angle]
when the context says what it expects --- and it never reaches Core, the
checker, the evaluator or generated code; a kernel hole term was
rejected because the kernel has no notion of an unfinished expression
and needs none. Expected information flows #emph[into] the slot from the
formal Composer's `solve`: the operator above it and the known sibling
determine its dimension; a product of two slots is #emph[insufficient
information] --- the formal model reports it unsolved rather than
searching, and Studio shows the position as not determined with a
sentence. That two-hole case is not a limitation to be engineered away:
local, deterministic inference is what makes the expectation explainable
in one sentence, and a global solver would trade that for guesses.

== Simulate, Deploy, Library, Monitor
<simulate-deploy-library-monitor>
#emph[Simulate] runs the reference evaluator over structured inputs per
tick (including list and pair values, and concept values in the design's
terms --- `Brightness(0.5)`), showing every declaration's value and
every output; the simulator does not get a separate interpretation.
#emph[Deploy] is the target-relative read model (ADR-0015): board
selection reruns deployment analysis only, and the workspace reports
validity and deployability in different places; the readiness matrix
(bounded-memory refusal, unbounded state, window capacity) is shown
here. #emph[Simulate] lists the Sources as its inputs and refuses to
step until each has a value; a probe on a concept names what carries it
and, on a rule, where it is applied. #emph[Library] is the previous
section's. #emph[Monitor] --- telemetry from a deployed core --- is a
placeholder page, as is the platform adapter it needs.

== What Studio does not decide
<what-studio-does-not-decide>
Studio computes no type validity, semantic identity, dimension,
causality, clock, output ownership, hardware feasibility or simulation;
it holds no parsed formula tree and no unit rule; it arranges nothing at
render time. Every one of those is a projection from the daemon, keyed
by `EntityRef` and role, never by text position or node id. That is the
discipline that lets the same facts appear as socket hues, inspector
sentences and Explain notation without three implementations of the
language.

= Part XIII --- Formal ↔ Production Correspondence
<part-xiii-formal-production-correspondence>
The formal development is a specification (ADR-0010): production
transcribes it and discharges it by tests; a theorem never proves the
Rust or Dart code. This Part states, construct by construct, the formal
object and its result, the production object and its status at the
snapshot, how strong the correspondence is, every known deviation with
its reason, and the proof gap that remains. The classification of each
row is one of: #strong[exact] (the production object is the

== The snapshot
<the-snapshot>
What is implemented, partial and planned at `de8154f`, with the protocol
history and the milestones of the last week, is Appendix F, so that this
Part's classification survives the next milestone and the snapshot is
updated in one place.

= Part XIV --- Minimality and the Rejected Alternatives
<part-xiv-minimality-and-the-rejected-alternatives>
The kernel was obtained by a method, and the method is part of the
record. Each phase of the formal development took a family of candidate
constructs --- from the earlier draft of the language, from the
production roadmap, or from the standard repertoire of typed functional
languages --- formalized the smallest plausible version and its
alternatives in Lean 4 without external libraries, and asked the same
questions of each: What does it reject that the others accept? What does
it accept that it should not? Is it a special case of another? Which
operations on a design are refinements under it? A construct entered the
kernel only when every tested alternative failed for a stated reason,
recorded as a theorem or an executable counterexample. Verdicts use one
vocabulary throughout this document and the formal records: KEEP IN
KERNEL, KEEP IN SURFACE-DESUGAR (or DEPLOYMENT CONSTRUCTION), KEEP IN
STANDARD LIBRARY, MOVE TO VALIDATION, MOVE TO AUTHORING/UI
(presentation), DEFER, REMOVE. Parts III--X give the verdict for each
construct where the construct is discussed; this Part is the ledger that
gathers them, and the construct-by-construct table with every row's
evidence is `docs/kernel/minimality.md` in the formal repository (the
decisions are `docs/decisions/`, FVD-0001 … FVD-0130).

== Two kinds of minimality
<two-kinds-of-minimality>
Two questions are asked of every construct, and they have different
answers more often than not.

#strong[Kernel minimality] asks whether the construct is needed for some
design to be representable or unambiguous, with a theorem or
counterexample as the argument. By this test `Signal`, `Event`, effect
rows, action values, a StateHandler, a group, a unit, a binder, a
polymorphic type, a Source kind and a provision primitive are all
#emph[unnecessary]: each is either derived from what exists or rejected
outright, and the kernel band of Part III's architecture figure is what
remains.

#strong[Designer-facing vocabulary minimality] asks whether the
construct captures a distinct design concept that cannot be expressed
cleanly as a property of an existing one --- the cognitive-budget test
of Part I. By this test a #strong[Source], a #strong[behavior] (group),
a #strong[natural binder], a #strong[unit] on a literal, a
#strong[choice] in the Formula Composer and a #strong[context] are all
#emph[valuable]: each names something a designer means, and each is kept
at the surface, in presentation, or as a design recommendation for a
surface not yet built. That a construct desugars away is a fact about
the kernel; it is never a reason to remove it from the product. The
Source is the clearest case --- nothing in the kernel distinguishes it,
the product draws it first --- and the provision result of Part IX is
what makes the two facts consistent: the surface concept is exactly a
realization state, and the state changes at deployment by a construction
the kernel already admits.

The verdicts below say which kind of minimality each row is about.
REMOVE is a kernel verdict and a surface verdict at once only where the
rejected table says so.

= Part XV --- The Open Agenda
<part-xv-the-open-agenda>
The agenda has two halves that must not be confused: questions of
semantics and formal correctness, which a theorem or a counterexample
would settle, and questions about designers, which only a study would.
Items production or the formal development has already answered are gone
from this list; each remaining item names what exists and what would
resolve it, and none is hidden in a "future work" sentence.

== Formal limits, stated once
<formal-limits-stated-once>
Causality is conservative for lambda-guarded cycles: `Causal` rejects
them and the negative theorem does not cover them. The agreement between
unfolding and tick-by-tick evaluation is proved for first-order wiring
designs; higher-order closure equivalence is not. Theorem J (modular
semantics) is proved for direct bindings on wiring designs with
closure-free inputs; transported bindings under `MEv` and higher-order
bodies are not covered, in either direction, for the same reason --- a
domain-indexed input for a transported port. Theorem R (extraction
preserves behavior) is likewise proved for single-domain wiring designs
without transported bindings. The StateHandler reduction covers the
tested behavior and not contexts with their own clocks or independently
clocked nesting. `InstAcyclic` is too coarse for extraction; a
port-level graph would subsume `flatten_causal` and `flat_causal`. Four
conditions rest on the abstract evidence relation (`Monotone`,
`Equivariant`, `PortSound`, `InterfaceLocal`), and production discharges
none of them because it authors no commitments. Hardware validation
covers discrete pin and peripheral allocation with unary and binary
constraints, and no numeric electrical, thermal or timing property; the
explanation facility reports a first dead end, not a minimal core.
Interface-level references --- commitments that mention other
declarations --- are not modelled, so the dependency graph is over
realizations only. Whether a realization may delegate its grant to a
higher-order argument is untested. The buffer correspondence assumes an
input source. The equation library's evaluation lemmas assume the
predicate value implements a Boolean function; the executed cases
discharge it. The exact unit model is related to production floating
point by a stated contract, not a theorem. Sums are encoded, not added.
Two-hole operands are outside `solve` by design. No parser is modelled
for the natural surface; its type annotations are the output of local
inference, described, not proved. Provision is proved for pure
transducers at the target's clock, and for shared raw readings with a
joint section where equality is claimed. No theorem covers the Rust or
Dart code.

== Open formal and engineering problems
<open-formal-and-engineering-problems>
+ #strong[A general edit/invalidation relation] (FVI-0015). Refinement
  is a preorder with proved client stability; an arbitrary edit is
  outside it and forces a recheck of dependents. Production classifies
  edits into seven invalidation categories (ADR-0009). Missing: a formal
  relation that says, per edit kind, exactly which established facts
  survive --- the theory behind incremental re-analysis. Would resolve:
  a proved per-category preservation theorem.
+ #strong[Commitments that depend on interface references] (FVI-0001;
  ISS-0003). A commitment is a property id discharged by evidence over
  the realization; a commitment mentioning #emph[another declaration]
  has no model, so interface-level cycles are invisible. Would resolve:
  an interface-level dependency relation and its interaction with
  refinement --- and, before it, any production authoring of commitments
  at all.
+ #strong[Lambda-guarded causality precision] (FVI-0003). `Causal`
  counts a reference under a lambda as instantaneous. Would resolve: a
  causality judgment with application sites and its totality theorem.
+ #strong[Higher-order closure equivalence] (FVI-0004).
  `unfolds_preserves_eval` holds for wiring designs. Would resolve: an
  equivalence of closures across unfolding, or a first-order
  normalization of higher-order realizations before unfolding.
+ #strong[Full multi-clock component semantics] (FVI-0006). Theorem J
  under `MEv` with transported bindings needs a domain-indexed
  consistent modular input and a proof of its existence. Production
  supports the case; the theorem does not.
+ #strong[Nested and stateful component elaboration limits] (FVI-0007,
  FVI-0009; ISS-0007, ISS-0010). `toComponent`'s side condition is
  decidable and unproved; packaging inside a component body is not
  modelled; contexts with handler-scoped clocks and independently
  clocked nesting were not examined, and production offers neither
  temporal modifiers nor contexts. Would resolve: an elaboration with a
  preservation theorem, or a counterexample forcing a kernel construct.
+ #strong[Affine physical arithmetic validation] (FVI-0017; ISS-0004).
  The point/difference sort as an operation-level validation, its rules
  (`affAdd`, `affSub`) at the surface, and the Composer offering only
  difference units for a delta slot. Would resolve: the validation and a
  decision to offer °C in formulas, or a decision not to need it.
+ #strong[Hardware: minimal unsatisfiable cores] (FVI-0011). `diagnose`
  reports a first dead end. Would resolve: a minimal core with a proof
  of minimality, or a decision that the first dead end is the better
  explanation.
+ #strong[Numeric electrical, thermal and timing constraints]
  (FVI-0011). Out of the solver's scope; a design can be allocated and
  still exceed a current budget. Would resolve: a numeric constraint
  layer beside the finite solver, with its own soundness.
+ #strong[A generated-code refinement proof.] The core is held to the
  reference evaluator by differential tests. Would resolve: a proof that
  lowering plus code generation refines `Ev`/`MEv` --- or a verified
  evaluator --- closing the largest deviation of Part XIII. A proved
  static bound analysis is the same gap on the capacity side. 11a.
  #strong[Output realization, next steps] (FVI-0022). Stateful output
  adapters (slew, dithering, batching, hysteresis) and whether each is
  the behavior's, a stateful lowering's with a stream-level theorem, or
  the backend's; the device-clock variant with an explicit `sync`\;
  whether an atomic multi-value frame ever forces a many-to-one
  lowering; the codegen half from the raw command trace to the generated
  backend call; commitments on outputs.
+ #strong[Source provision, next steps] (FVI-0020; PRP-0001, ISS-0016).
  Stateful transducers and a stream-level transparency theorem; a device
  clock with a deployment `sync`\; how a profile's declared range
  discharges a Source's commitments; output provision, the dual; whether
  `computes` is checked or trusted at the catalogue; out-of-type raw
  readings as validation; and, on the production side, the device
  catalogue and the implementation itself.
+ #strong[Enums and sums] (ISS-0005). Encoded as tag × optional payload;
  production keeps user enums open. Would resolve: a case that needs
  `match` exhaustiveness beyond the encoding, and then one eliminator
  term former like `fold`\; or a decision that the encoding is the
  language.
+ #strong[A surface form for occurrence windows] (FVI-0012 in part;
  ISS-0001), so a bounded refinement can be recognized and a ring
  representation offered without a hidden transformation.
+ #strong[Several candidate definitions with one active] (FVI-0014;
  ISS-0002): whether this is a surface convenience over a write-once
  kernel realization.
+ #strong[Grant delegation] (FVI-0018): whether a realization may
  delegate its grant to a higher-order argument; the display-name table
  and the preferred display unit as presentation objects (FVI-0019).
+ #strong[A mathematical specification backend and a verification
  backend.] The kernel is a specification; a backend rendering a design
  as a mathematical document for engineering hand-off does not exist;
  commitments beyond typing have an evidence slot and no discharge
  mechanism; the exact chart model and the choice-free rational field
  are the first pieces of a verification story about quantities.
+ #strong[Production engineering items with no formal content]:
  projection deltas and a persisted edit history (ISS-0009); a
  structural diagnostic entity for outputs (ISS-0008); a linear `zip` in
  the core (ISS-0013); the compiler's diagnostic sentences in every
  locale (ISS-0015); the first platform adapter, build orchestration,
  flash and telemetry (production's roadmap priorities 1--4).

== Empirical questions, explicitly
<empirical-questions-explicitly>
The interaction model of Part II and Part XII is fully described,
largely built, and no part of it has been evaluated with users. The
following are hypotheses, to be tested, and nothing in this document ---
no theorem, no test, no differential corpus --- is evidence for any of
them:

- that an unresolved typed relationship is a natural stopping point for
  designers, and that its cost is close to zero;
- that Source, Rule and Value are learnable as one distinction, and that
  #emph[not applied] with an offered value is understood;
- that socket hue for identity and socket shape for value form are read
  correctly without type labels;
- that the three information levels place each fact where a designer
  looks for it, and that Explain is opened rarely and usefully;
- that the Formula Composer's slot expectations and candidate lists
  reduce the semantic-translation cost the workshop exposed, and that
  designers read `all reading in readings:` better than
  `all(readings, reading => …)`\;
- that product-language diagnostics ("This adds an angle and a time"\;
  "Mode values have no default order") are understood and acted on;
- that Design, Code and Split are experienced as views of one thing, and
  that semantic colour in the Code view helps rather than distracts;
- that groups, packaging and instances match how designers organize
  behavior;
- learnability across the vocabulary; productivity against a Node-RED-
  or Arduino-style baseline; cognitive load in the sense of the
  cognitive-dimensions framework.

The studies that would answer them are restated below with their
measures. Neither has been run.

=== Expected cognitive advantages, as hypotheses
<expected-cognitive-advantages-as-hypotheses>
#strong[Lower viscosity.] Changing a transfer function edits one Mapping
definition rather than a procedural chain of read/compute/store/write
nodes.

#strong[Reduced hidden dependencies.] Semantic signatures expose what a
relationship consumes and produces, while the kernel rejects
incompatible connections before device code exists.

#strong[Reduced premature commitment.] An unresolved declaration allows
a designer to commit to a relationship without committing to its
implementation, sensor, or exact parameters.

This last item requires a qualification that the rest do not.
Signature-first authoring is not claimed to be the spontaneous habit of
every designer. The author, working on a hardware project, adopted it
when the complexity of a subsystem exceeded what could be held in view
at once, and did not adopt it on simpler tasks, where a signature and
its definition were written in a single motion. The hypothesis is
therefore narrower than a claim about how designers think. It is that
conventional tools provide no legal position for an undefined
relationship, so the strategy cannot be adopted even when it would help,
and that BDL supplies that position at no cost. Whether inexperienced
designers take up the strategy once it is available, and whether doing
so improves their designs, is an empirical question and is included in
the comparative study.

#strong[Better role expressiveness.] Contexts, Mappings, and temporal
modifiers correspond to product-design concepts rather than generic
program-control constructs.

#strong[Improved error locality.] A mismatch is attached to a product
relationship or binding rather than surfacing later as an embedded
runtime fault, and a hardware infeasibility is attached to the binding
that causes it.

=== Comparative study
<comparative-study>
A first controlled study should compare BDL against at least two
baselines: a statechart-based prototyping environment and a node-based
or Arduino-style implementation workflow. Participants should be
industrial-design students and practitioners with limited professional
software-engineering experience.

Tasks should include specifying a sensor-to-actuator mapping; adding
temporal qualification such as “for 300 ms”; adding an orthogonal safety
override that competes with an interaction context for one output;
replacing a sensor with a different sample rate; relating a slowly
updated quantity to a fast interaction, which forces a cross-domain
decision; choosing a board that cannot accommodate the design; and
modifying a mapping late in the task.

Primary outcomes should not be limited to task time or a usability
scale. More important measures are semantic errors in the final
behavior; the number of implementation-only concepts participants must
manipulate; time to detect an impossible or conflicting behavior;
fidelity between verbal design intent and the elaborated model; the
number and diversity of behavior alternatives explored; the quality of
handoff to an engineer who did not observe the authoring session;
subjective confidence calibrated against actual correctness; and
whether, and at what level of task complexity, participants declare a
relationship before defining it when the tool permits both.

The last measure tests the hypothesis stated above rather than assuming
it. Because signature-first authoring may be a strategy that appears
only above a complexity threshold, the tasks should vary in scale, and
the default state of a newly created relationship is itself a
manipulable factor: a block that opens onto an empty formula editor and
one that opens onto a signature with an explicitly legal undefined body
invite different first actions. A small comparison of these two defaults
is considerably cheaper than the full study.

The interaction model of Part II adds hypotheses of its own. Whether the
single-driver diagnostic leads participants to an explicit combination
block they can later read, whether the cross-domain question is answered
correctly for a safety condition, and whether participants distinguish a
valid design from a deployable one when the workspace reports them
separately, are each measurable in the tasks above.

=== Field study
<field-study>
A controlled study cannot establish whether the representation fits real
design practice. A second phase should embed the tool in a semester-long
product-design studio or an industry project. The study should observe
where unresolved declarations persist, which semantic types designers
invent, where they request escape hatches, how often the single-driver
condition is met by a combination rule the designer finds natural, and
how often engineers reinterpret or replace BDL artifacts during
implementation. This field evidence is necessary before claiming that
the language is native to industrial design rather than merely pleasant
to its authors.

== Risks of the design
<risks-of-the-design>
#strong[Semantic-type proliferation.] If every semantic distinction
creates a visible type, the editor may become bureaucratic. The system
needs reusable type libraries and sensible defaults, and the study
should record which types designers invent.

#strong[Formula anxiety.] Not every designer wants to write equations.
Formula authoring must coexist with curves, examples, and direct
manipulation.

#strong[Hidden elaboration.] A context that elaborates to an activation
declaration, an entry declaration, gated state, and a conditional driver
is, in the elaborated design, several objects the designer did not draw.
Hiding this can make runtime behavior mysterious. The explanation view
of the interaction model is the proposed answer; whether designers use
it, and whether it explains what they came to ask, is untested.

#strong[False confidence.] A formally typed diagram can look verified
even when no physical property has been checked, and a typed, causal,
clock-consistent, output-complete design can be unplaceable on the
chosen board. The workspace states of the interaction model exist to
keep these apart, and the risk is sharpest for obligations discharged by
declaration rather than by analysis.

#strong[Complexity migration into tooling.] Much of what was removed
from the kernel --- event policies, output selection, context semantics
--- reappears as elaboration. The kernel is smaller and better
understood; the elaborator is larger, and it exists (Part IX) and is
held to the kernel by differential testing rather than by proof (Part
XIII). The claim that the surface is “only syntax” over the kernel is a
claim about tested cases, and the untested cases are the ones most
likely to demand a kernel extension.

#strong[Usability hypotheses unestablished.] Every statement in this
document about what designers find natural is a hypothesis, including
every sentence of the interaction model. The one anecdote reported is a
single author's practice on a single project.

= Intellectual Context and Related Work
<intellectual-context-and-related-work>
This chapter places BDL against the traditions it intersects: what it
borrows from each, and where its abstraction boundary differs. Each
subsection ends with that difference, stated as a difference in
#emph[artifact] or #emph[author], not as a claim of superiority; the
chapter is context for the design, not a case for its novelty.

== Industrial design tools and physical prototyping
<industrial-design-tools-and-physical-prototyping>
Phidgets reduced the implementation cost of physical interaction by
presenting hardware components through a uniform software abstraction
@greenberg2001phidgets. d.tools integrated physical prototyping,
statechart-based behavior, testing, and analysis for designers
@hartmann2006dtools. Exemplar addressed the same authoring cost from the
opposite direction, letting designers demonstrate sensor behavior and
having the system infer the recognizer @hartmann2007exemplar\; in BDL
that technique is one of several ways to supply a definition, attached
to a signature that already fixes the relationship's semantic boundary.
The Arduino ecosystem @arduino2024 is the de facto medium of the
workshop reported in Part I, and its
`loop()`/`digitalRead`/`analogWrite` vocabulary is the operational
structure whose missing "place for a fact" motivated the language. The
difference from these systems is not that they could not represent
behavior. It is that their dominant representation still asks designers
to formulate substantial portions of behavior in an operational
structure; BDL investigates whether the typed semantic relationship can
be the primary artifact, with operational machinery elaborated
underneath.

== Visual programming and end-user programming
<visual-programming-and-end-user-programming>
Node-RED @openjs2024nodered is the closest deployed representative of
the flow-graph medium that Part II analyses: nodes are computations
wired by message passing, and the graph is a dependency view onto an
event loop. Scratch and its block-language descendants
@resnick2009scratch showed that syntax can be removed as an obstacle
without removing the program-counter model, and Part II's argument is
precisely that the program counter, not the syntax, is the cost for
designers. End-user software engineering @ko2011enduser documents the
tension between low-threshold authoring and the errors that follow from
the absence of static structure; BDL's answer is to make the static
structure --- semantic identity, dimension, domain, single driver ---
the medium, and to make it legible through the three information levels
rather than through diagnostics after the fact. Cognitive dimensions
@green1996cognitive supplies the vocabulary --- viscosity, hidden
dependencies, premature commitment --- in which Part XV's empirical
questions are posed.

== Synchronous languages and functional reactive programming
<synchronous-languages-and-functional-reactive-programming>
The kernel's temporal basis is that of the synchronous dataflow
tradition. Lustre's `pre` with an initial value, in a
declaration-per-stream setting, is the delay primitive here
@halbwachs1991lustre\; the rule that a value computed at an instant is
visible at the next instant, applied across domains, is the
strictly-before rule; and causality as a static property follows the
same line @colaco2005state. Esterel established the synchronous
hypothesis under which these semantics are deterministic
@berry1992esterel, and SCADE industrialized the tradition with a
qualified code generator @berry2007scade --- the destination that Part
XV's "generated-code refinement proof" would move BDL toward. Where
these languages recover clocks by a clock calculus @colaco2003clocks,
BDL requires domain identity to be declared, for the reason given in
Part VII. Zélus extends the lineage to hybrid systems @bourke2013zelus,
which is the direction in which the continuous-dynamics limitation would
have to be addressed.

Functional reactive programming established behaviors and events as
compositional abstractions for time-varying computation
@elliott1997fran, and FrTime gave a dynamic dataflow embedding with
formal semantics @cooper2006frtime. BDL's reactive core is much more
restricted, and the restriction is a result rather than a starting
point: under a tick semantics with one domain, a signal type rejects
nothing and an event type is an optional-valued stream, so neither
appears in the kernel; across domains, the event buffer is five
declarations over `sync` and lists (Part VII).

== Model-based design, statecharts and systems engineering
<model-based-design-statecharts-and-systems-engineering>
LabVIEW established the graphical dataflow instrument-control paradigm;
Simulink with Stateflow combines dataflow blocks with hierarchical state
machines; Modelica models physical systems through acausal equations
with units and dimensions
@national2024labview@mathworks2024simulink@modelica2023spec. These
systems are considerably more capable than BDL. The distinction is in
the primary artifact and the intended author: in each of them the
artifact is an executable model whose blocks denote computation and the
author holds an engineering model; BDL's artifact is a set of typed
relationships that need not yet compute anything, and the author holds a
product model. Statecharts @harel1987statecharts are the representation
that BDL's #emph[contexts] replace for the designer: a context is a
named situation with an activation condition, elaborated to gated and
reset state and a conditional driver, rather than a transition table the
designer maintains. SysML and model-based systems engineering address
precise system structure, requirements, and verification at a broader
level @omg2025sysml\; BDL is intended as a front end for early design
that could later export into such representations, not as a replacement.

The model-driven-architecture ladder is a useful comparison because
BDL's boundary sits at a different rung. Classic MDA moves a
computation-independent model through a platform-independent and a
platform-specific model to an implementation, and the
platform-independent artifact is already a software model --- classes,
components, messages. BDL's artifact is a behavior design plus a
realization and deployment step, and the behavior design is itself
executable, formal and simulatable #emph[before] any software ontology
appears: its objects are concepts, relationships, domains and outputs,
and the elaborator, the generated core and the platform adapter are the
rungs below it. BDL places the platform-independent boundary above the
conventional software-implementation ontology; it does not replace MDA,
and a BDL design could be the input to an MDA pipeline that starts where
BDL's deployment step ends.

== Typed holes, live and structured editing, projectional editing
<typed-holes-live-and-structured-editing-projectional-editing>
Hazelnut demonstrated that incomplete structured terms can remain
statically meaningful under bidirectional typing @omar2017hazelnut, and
Hazel extended this to live evaluation around holes @omar2019live. BDL
takes the idea that incompleteness is a first-class static state and
relocates it: the kernel object is a named declaration whose realization
is optional; holes are positional in the Hazelnut tradition and named
here at the declaration level, while the Formula Composer's slot `?`
(Part VI, Part XII) is a positional hole #emph[inside] a definition,
elaborated as an expression with an unresolved type and never shipped.
The stability result concerns clients of a declaration under refinement
rather than the typing of the incomplete term itself. Projectional
editors @voelter2014projectional edit an AST directly and render it; the
Composer is deliberately not one --- the text remains the source of
truth and the Composer is a projection over it (ADR-0028), which is why
byte-range edits, ephemeral node identity and a stale-projection policy
exist at all. Cognitive dimensions @green1996cognitive frames the
trade-off these editors make and the one BDL makes.

== Dimensional typing and units
<dimensional-typing-and-units>
Dimensional typing follows the units-of-measure line begun by Kennedy
@kennedy1997units. What is specific here is the placement --- the
algebra in primitive operator types with no dimension-specific rule, and
the separation of dimension from nominal identity --- together with the
mechanized observation that the numeric baseline is the erasure. Part VI
goes further than the units-of-measure literature usually does in two
respects: units are #emph[coordinates on a dimension] with a symbolic
exact scale group, and affine units are charts whose conversions form a
groupoid of affine maps with a proved point/difference decomposition;
Modelica's `displayUnit` @modelica2023spec is the closest deployed
analogue of Part VI's presentation layer.

== Effects
<effects>
An earlier draft of BDL borrowed the separation between operation and
interpretation from algebraic effects @plotkin2013handlers and
anticipated scoped effects for context-sensitive interpretation
@yang2022scoped. The kernel has no effect system. The negative result is
stated narrowly in Part IX and does not bear on effect systems in
general; it bears on the formulations tried for this design problem,
where a single explicit driver per output expressed everything the
request-and-policy model expressed and made visible what it hid.

== Resource allocation
<resource-allocation>
The hardware validation layer is a finite constraint satisfaction
problem with unary and binary constraints @dechter2003constraint, and
its solver is a plain backtracking search whose soundness and
completeness are proved. No claim is made relative to the embedded
co-design literature; what is specific to the layer is architectural ---
the design is never an input to the solver, and feasibility is kept as a
separate, non-monotone kind of evidence --- rather than algorithmic.

== Formal verification, verified compilation and differential testing
<formal-verification-verified-compilation-and-differential-testing>
The kernel is mechanized in Lean 4 @moura2021lean without external
libraries, and every result in this document rests on propositional
extensionality and quotient soundness alone. The relationship between
the kernel and the production compiler is #emph[specification], not
#emph[extraction]: production reimplements the reference evaluator in
Rust and holds itself to it by differential testing
@mckeeman1998differential over a corpus (Part XI). This is the weakest
link in the trust chain (Part XIII) and the point where a
verified-compiler approach in the CompCert tradition @leroy2009compcert
would apply; Part XV lists a refinement proof from lowering to
`Ev`/`MEv` as an open problem. The choice-free rational field of Part VI
was built because importing a general-purpose library would have brought
classical choice into the axiom base; that discipline is a
methodological choice of this project and not a claim about the
libraries.

== Embedded DSLs and toolchains
<embedded-dsls-and-toolchains>
Production BDL's shape --- a daemon with a project model, a compiler
producing a `no_std` core, and a thin platform adapter --- is a
conventional embedded-DSL toolchain, and no novelty is claimed for it.
What is specific is the placement of the semantics: the generated core
is held to a reference evaluator that is itself held to a mechanized
kernel, and the capacity, bounds and allocation questions are answered
at validation rather than by a runtime allocator (Part VII, Part XI).

= Appendix A --- Formal notation
<appendix-a-formal-notation>
The notation is the Lean development's, kept uniform across Parts
III--X; where an earlier phase used a different spelling the current one
is used throughout and the old one is mentioned only in Appendix G.

#strong[On categorical language.] Where the text says that the canonical
types form an interface layer whose normalization is inverse to
encoding, or that compatible charts form a #emph[groupoid] of affine
isomorphisms, the claims are theorem-level statements in the development
(`decode_encode`, `convert_compose`, `convert_inverse`) and the
categorical words are explanatory. No categorical framework is
formalized; "realization as a functor preserving composition" and
"natural transformations between elaborations" are intuitions for future
work, not results.

= Appendix C --- Decision index
<appendix-c-decision-index>
Every formal design decision by its stable identifier, with the Part of
this document that discusses it, the Lean files that carry its evidence,
and the production record it supports, audits or bears on. The records
themselves --- choice, alternatives rejected, formal reason --- are
`docs/decisions/` in the formal repository; the map from the retired
ledger numbers is Appendix E. Status is #emph[accepted] for every
record; FVD-0106 carries a Phase-10b amendment and FVD-0098 records the
partial reversal of FVD-0090's `lt` generalisation.

= Appendix E --- Migration map from the old decision numbers
<appendix-e-migration-map-from-the-old-decision-numbers>
Until 2026-09-20 the formal decisions were `D-01 … D-130`, numbered in
the order they were written in one ledger; the open items were
unnumbered bullets, and for a few hours on the same day `OI-NN`. The
stable identifiers keep the sequence number (`D-07` → `FVD-0007`) so
that a citation in a commit message, an archived draft or a conversation
can be followed by hand; the number encodes neither a phase nor a
production record. Archived documents (`paper/archive/`, the dated
entries of `paper/NOTES.md`) keep the old numbers and are not rewritten.
Production's records at the snapshot still cite the old numbers
(ADR-0024, ADR-0025, `formal-correspondence.md`, `status.md`); this
table resolves each. The canonical copy is
`docs/project/decision-id-migration.md` in the formal repository.

== Implementation status, by area (production's own words, abridged)
<implementation-status-by-area-productions-own-words-abridged>
#strong[Implemented:] the language core through outputs and
completeness; formula language v0 with the slot; the natural forms; one
canonical type per relationship; the unit registry with linear charts
offered and affine charts as tested infrastructure (ISS-0004); the data
core and the equation library; the compiler and simulator with
product-language diagnostics and Explain; the Rust backend with
differential, golden and property tests over 22 corpus cases;
collections at deployment (static bounds, window capacity,
bounded-memory refusal, `bdld compile --bounded-memory --period`);
hardware and deployment analysis with Nano and a larger board file;
behavior systems, groups, packaging, versions and substitution; the
unified project format with migration and complete persistence; the
layout service; text ↔ graph synchronisation; the IDE service and LSP
with a VS Code extension, semantic tokens and the Composer queries; the
protocol and daemon at 0.21; the Standard Library (36 Concept items, 8
Source items); localization (partial: the compiler's diagnostic
sentences are English, ISS-0015).

#strong[Partial --- Studio:] the Design page with Design, Code and Split
views, the canvas with roles, reference edges and groups, the inspector
with the Formula | Text definition editor, the Formula Composer with
references, literals, slots, operators, calls, binders, ranges, boolean
logic and choices structured and richer forms as text, Simulate with
Sources as inputs, Deploy on the 0.5 read model, Library, the conflict
banner, colour from semantic tokens. Not built: the Monitor page (a
placeholder), a device binding for a Source (ISS-0016), Explain over a
protocol request, domain regions and cycle emphasis on the canvas,
entity hover and fixes inside a component's source, a native menu bar.

#strong[Planned, designed, not implemented:] the first platform adapter
(Embassy; roadmap priority 1), build orchestration, flash, telemetry, a
second embedded target; supplied Rust components (ADR-0005); the device
catalogue and PRP-0001.

#strong[Not implemented by decision:] user enums (ISS-0005), temporal
modifiers and contexts (ISS-0010), a surface form for occurrence windows
(ISS-0001), record syntax, `forall`/`exists` sugar, `Set`/interval/sum
types, an `A -> ()` consumer form.

== Facts this document relies on that could move
<facts-this-document-relies-on-that-could-move>
Protocol version numbers; the count of library items; the list of
structured Composer forms (`let`, `match`, blocks and rules are text at
the snapshot); the roadmap order; the two known code-side drifts
production recorded while auditing its own docs (an action's reason
string; a test's doc comment). When any of these moves, this appendix
and the correspondence page move; the conceptual chapters do not.

= Appendix G --- Development chronology
<appendix-g-development-chronology>
The order in which the hypotheses were tested. Phase numbers are
provenance, not structure: the conceptual chapters cite them so that a
reader can find the report that holds the experiment, and the reports
(`docs/reports/` in the formal repository) are the local records ---
question, models tried, theorems with their hypotheses, executed cases,
claim audit, verdicts --- from which this document's chapters were
synthesized. A report is written once and corrected by strike-through
when a later phase overturns a claim (Phase 9c did this to 9b's
structural order; Phase 10b to 10's sort). Dates are the commits that
added each report.

Notation changed once: Phases 0--1 spoke of #emph[holes] (`HoleId`,
`holeRef`); the post-Phase-1 migration (FVD-0015) replaced the
vocabulary with declarations, and every later phase uses the current
notation of Appendix A. Phase 9b's structural order and Phase 10's
point/difference sort were revised by 9c and 10b; the earlier positions
are kept in the reports and in Part XIV's #emph[decisions that changed]
table.

<closing>
Modern industrial products increasingly combine physical form with
sensing, computation, and control, yet designers still lack a behavior
medium with the immediacy that CAD provides for geometry. BDL proposes
that the missing medium should not be a friendlier version of procedural
programming. It should be a language in which typed product
relationships are first-class design artifacts, and in which an
unresolved relationship is a legal state of the design rather than a
defect in a program.

What that looks like in use is a workspace in which a designer names
what the product is about, draws the relationships between those things,
and leaves each undefined until there is something to say; refines them
locally, by formula or curve or example, without the diagram changing
shape; states time as a qualifier rather than as a timer; gives
situations a name and a boundary rather than a transition table; is
asked for one final target where two behaviors reach for one output, and
for one stated way of seeing across a boundary where two quantities move
at different speeds; and chooses a board last, receiving either a pin
allocation or a conflict, with the design itself untouched either way.

The kernel that supports this is small, and it is small for reasons that
were checked. A declaration has a frozen type, growable public
commitments, and a write-once body; clients are typed against the type
view, and refinement preserves what they established while edits reopen
it. Semantic concepts are nominal, represented through a write-once
binding, and constructed only where a signature announces them;
dimensions are carried by the types of primitive operators. One temporal
primitive reads a clock domain at its previous activation, and
single-domain delay is its diagonal; evaluation is deterministic and
total exactly on causal designs; every designer-facing temporal operator
is a shape over it. Clock domains are nominal and checked by a judgment
rather than a type; crossings are explicit, initialized, and strictly
earlier. Physical outputs are nominal sinks with one driver each, and
every combination of behaviors is ordinary computation upstream of the
drive edge. A separate validation layer decides whether the design fits
a board, and its evidence is kept apart from the evidence that survives
refinement.

Each of these is minimal among the designs that were tested, and this
document has tried to say, for each, what was proved, what was rejected
by counterexample, and what was preferred. The elaborator, the editor
and the host-side firmware path have been built and are described in
Parts XI--XII; the platform adapter and the device catalogue have not;
the studies have not, and they are where the claims about designers
would be tested. The research question is not whether designers can be
taught a simpler programming language. It is whether product behavior
can become a #emph[design material] whose structure is intuitive at the
surface and rigorous underneath, and the kernel presented here is the
part of that question that can now be stated precisely.
