= Introduction
<introduction>
Industrial design is increasingly concerned with products whose behavior
is determined not only by geometry, materials, and mechanisms, but also
by sensing, logic, timing, software, and networked control. A cup may
infer that it has been lifted, a lamp may adapt to ambient conditions, a
medical device may gate an action on multiple safety conditions, and a
consumer robot may continuously map sensor estimates to actuator
behavior. In such products, behavior is no longer a late implementation
detail. It is part of the product concept.

Yet the dominant design media remain asymmetrical. Industrial designers
have mature media for shape, layout, appearance, and physical assembly,
while product behavior is usually externalized through prose,
storyboards, flowcharts, state diagrams, interactive mock-ups, or ad hoc
embedded code. The first four are easy to sketch but weak as executable
specifications; the last is executable but forces the designer to adopt
implementation-oriented concepts such as mutable variables, callbacks,
polling loops, and device APIs. Existing physical prototyping systems
such as Phidgets and d.tools substantially lowered the cost of building
interactive prototypes @greenberg2001phidgets@hartmann2006dtools, but
their behavioral representations still inherit important assumptions
from programming and state-machine formalisms.

A concrete instance of the resulting cost appeared in a two-day
introductory hardware workshop that one of the authors designed and
taught for ten participants with no prior embedded experience. Two of
the available sensors behaved in opposite ways: the ambient-light sensor
reports larger values as illumination increases, while the distance
sensor reports smaller values as the target recedes. Participants lost
track of which was which, repeatedly and across the whole group. This
pattern suggests a representational problem rather than merely a
syntactic one. Whether a reading rises or falls with the quantity it
measures is a stable fact about a device, and in the code they were
writing there was nowhere to record it. It survived only as a sign
buried inside an expression and had to be reconstructed each time it was
needed. The obstacle was not syntax. A piece of semantic information had
no place to live.

This paper proposes a different boundary. The goal is not to make
engineering representations merely easier for designers to use. The goal
is to define a #emph[native representation of product behavior for
design itself], while retaining enough formal structure for static
checking, simulation, and eventual implementation.

We call the proposed system #strong[BDL], a Behavior Design Language.
BDL is organized around a working hypothesis: when a behavioral
relationship is first specified, #emph[what kind of relationship should
exist] is frequently settled before its exact implementation is. A
designer may know that #strong[Tilt influences Brightness] before
deciding the transfer function; that #strong[CupPickedUp] should
activate a behavior before deciding which sensor and threshold detect
pickup; or that a safety condition should suppress an actuator before
choosing the device driver. Therefore the primary design artifact should
be the #emph[typed relationship], not the procedure that computes it.

The central example is a Mapping Block. Instead of decomposing a design
into procedural steps such as “read tilt,” “calculate brightness,” and
“set the LED,” BDL represents one mapping:

$ ? f : upright("Tilt") arrow.r upright("Brightness") . $

The mapping may exist before its body. A formula, curve, examples, or a
fitted function can later be attached as a definition of the same block.
Once a formula is supplied, for example

$ f\(theta\)= "clamp" (0.2 + 0.8 theta / 60^compose \, 0 \, 1)\, $

it inhabits the previously declared signature. The claim attached to
this #strong[signature-first] model is deliberately narrow. It is not
that designers universally think in signatures before bodies, nor that
they should be trained to. It is that an unresolved typed relationship
is a legal, statically meaningful state of the design, so that stopping
between declaring a relationship and realizing it costs nothing. Whether
designers make use of that position, and at what level of task
complexity, is an empirical question that this paper leaves open.

BDL separates a designer-facing surface language from a small formal
kernel. The kernel presented here was not designed on paper and then
implemented. It was derived by a mechanized design-space exploration in
the Lean 4 proof assistant @moura2021lean: each candidate construct from
an earlier draft of the language was formalized, attacked with
counterexamples, reduced to other constructs where possible, and kept
only when the tested alternatives failed for a stated reason. The result
is smaller than the draft it replaced. Clock-indexed signal types, a
separate event type, effect rows, action requests, and runtime actuator
arbitration were all removed, each for a reason recorded in the
accompanying development. What remains is an environment of named
declarations with frozen expected types, monotone public commitments,
and write-once realizations; nominal semantic types whose values can be
constructed only inside a declaration whose own signature announces the
concept; physical dimensions carried in the types of primitive
operators; one temporal primitive that reads a clock domain at its
previous activation; nominal clock domains with a separate domain
judgment; and nominal physical outputs with a single explicit driver
each. A validation layer outside the kernel decides whether a design can
be placed on a declared target board.

The paper is organized as three views of the same language. The first is
the design problem and the vocabulary a designer sees. The second is the
formal architecture that gives that vocabulary a precise meaning, stated
for each construct with what was proved, what was rejected by
counterexample, and what was merely preferred. The third, which connects
the two, is the interaction model: what a designer does in the
environment over the life of a design, what can be left undecided, and
what the tool says when something is wrong. An elaboration architecture
and an evaluation plan follow; no elaborator, editor, firmware
generator, or user study has yet been built, and the paper does not
report one.

= The Representation Problem
<the-representation-problem>
== The target user is not a programmer with fewer syntax skills
<the-target-user-is-not-a-programmer-with-fewer-syntax-skills>
Many low-code and visual programming systems reduce textual syntax while
preserving the underlying computational ontology: variables,
assignments, loops, callbacks, functions, transitions, and scheduling.
For software developers this can be convenient. For industrial
designers, however, the dominant difficulty is often not syntax but
#emph[semantic translation]. The designer begins with a product
statement such as “while the cup is held, brightness follows tilt” and
must translate it into implementation machinery.

BDL therefore follows a stronger criterion: a surface primitive should
be exposed only when it corresponds to a concept that is independently
meaningful in the design task. A mutable accumulator used to count
samples is generally not such a concept; “three pickup events within ten
minutes” is. A polling loop is generally not; “while the product is
held” is. A callback is not; “when the button is pressed” is.

The language should directly expose semantic properties, time-varying
quantities, discrete occurrences, typed mappings, conditions, behavioral
contexts, temporal relations, physical outputs, and safety constraints.
By default it should hide program counters, threads, callbacks,
continuations, clock variables, and bus transactions. These may remain
inspectable in an expert or debugging view, but they are not the primary
design medium.

== A flow graph is a dependency view, not a program counter
<a-flow-graph-is-a-dependency-view-not-a-program-counter>
BDL uses a flow-like canvas because causal and functional paths are
useful visual structures. The arrows do #strong[not] mean “execute the
left node and then the right node.” They mean that the target
relationship depends on the source relationship or value.

Consider the procedural decomposition:

```text
[Cup picked up]
      |
[Read tilt]
      |
[Compute L = f(theta)]
      |
[Set LED brightness]
```

This decomposition is rejected as a primary design representation
because the “read,” “compute,” and “set” nodes are artifacts of an
execution model. The corresponding BDL view is a `Held` context
containing a mapping from `Tilt` to `Brightness`. The formula is a
property of that mapping, and the realization layer later binds the
mapping's value to a physical light output.

The distinction matters because it changes what the designer edits. In a
procedure-centric editor, changing an implementation may require
rewriting steps and intermediate state. In BDL, changing a transfer
function edits the definition of one relationship while preserving the
surrounding product logic. This is not only a matter of presentation.
Realizing or refining one declaration leaves every other declaration's
typing untouched, and leaves every commitment that was already
discharged in place, provided the evidence for those commitments does
not depend on what was still unknown.

== Cognitive budget
<cognitive-budget>
The surface language must remain intentionally small. Each additional
primitive has a cost in learnability, visibility, consistency, and
error-proneness, all familiar concerns in the Cognitive Dimensions
tradition @green1996cognitive. BDL therefore uses a #emph[cognitive
budget]: a new visible construct is justified only when it captures a
distinct design concept that cannot be expressed cleanly as a property
of an existing construct.

The same budget was applied to the kernel, under a stricter test. A
kernel construct earns its place only if removing it makes some design
either unrepresentable or ambiguous, and the argument for each is a
theorem or a counterexample rather than a preference. Several constructs
that the surface exposes as distinct concepts turned out, under that
test, to be derived forms. Every temporal modifier reduces to one delay
primitive. Every cross-domain policy reduces to one transport primitive
plus ordinary data. Every output-selection policy reduces to ordinary
computation upstream of a single drive edge.

== Progressive disclosure is a semantic property
<progressive-disclosure-is-a-semantic-property>
A design tool can be visually simple and still force premature
decisions. BDL instead treats progressive disclosure as part of the
language semantics. A design may contain a declaration whose realization
is intentionally absent. Later steps may refine the same declaration
with mathematical properties, a body, a clock domain, an output binding,
and a target board. Each step is either a #emph[refinement], which
preserves everything previously established, or an #emph[edit], which is
permitted but reopens the validation of dependents. That distinction is
made precise in the section on declarations, and it is the organizing
principle of the interaction model.

= BDL from the Designer's Side
<bdl-from-the-designers-side>
This section presents the language as a designer encounters it. Every
construct here is a surface form; the architecture section states which
forms are kernel primitives and which are derived.

== Semantic properties and signatures
<semantic-properties-and-signatures>
The first-class visual object in BDL is a #emph[semantic property], not
a raw scalar. Examples include `Tilt`, `Brightness`, `Temperature`,
`CupContact`, and `MotorAngle`. Each semantic property has a
representation, and may carry units, ranges, and documentation, but its
identity is what the language tracks. `Tilt` and `MotorAngle` may share
an angular dimension without being interchangeable design concepts, and
the kernel keeps them apart by identity rather than by representation.

A Mapping Block is created from a signature

$ m :\(A_1\,dots.h\,A_n\)arrow.r B . $

At creation time the implementation may be absent:

$ ? m :\(A_1\,dots.h\,A_n\)arrow.r B . $

This is a valid partial artifact. The editor can already reject wires
with incompatible types, propagate semantic types downstream, show
documentation for the intended relationship, and record additional
properties such as monotonicity.

This design deliberately exploits the information density of a function
type. `Real -> Real` reveals little. `Tilt -> Brightness` already
communicates much of the design intent. More refined signatures can add
dimensions and representation constraints without forcing those details
into the main canvas.

== Mapping Blocks
<mapping-blocks>
A Mapping Block has a stable identity, a display name, a signature, an
optional definition, and a set of declared properties. A definition may
be a mathematical expression, a piecewise curve, a set of input-output
examples to be fitted, or a reference to an external component. All
definition forms elaborate to the same kernel realization, so different
authoring styles do not fragment the semantic model.

Three consequences follow from separating identity from definition.

#strong[Identity belongs to the signature.] The internal identity is
stable across every change to the definition; the display name is
mutable, so renaming is a refactoring that updates all reference sites
rather than a textual edit. Because a mapping can be named before it can
be computed, the rest of the model may refer to it, compose with it, and
state properties about it while it is still undefined. Declared
properties such as monotonicity attach to the identity, not to any
particular definition, and other declarations may rely on them.

#strong[The unresolved state is a state of the same object.] Behind a
Mapping Block is a declaration whose realization is optional. An
unresolved block is a declaration with no realization; it is not a
separate kind of thing. The word #emph[hole] is retained in the editor
as a designer-facing metaphor for this state, because it communicates
intentional openness better than “declaration without realization.” It
is not a kernel concept.

#strong[Attaching a definition is a refinement; replacing or detaching
one is an edit.] A block may be given a definition once as a refinement
step. Replacing the definition with a different one, or removing it, is
permitted, but it is an edit: other declarations may have discharged
commitments through the old definition, and they must be rechecked. The
editor may keep several candidate definitions with one active as a
surface convenience; whether this reduces to the write-once kernel
realization is an open item.

Nothing in this record imposes an authoring order. Declaring a signature
and attaching a formula may be a single action, exactly as a type
signature and an equation are written together in a functional language.
What the record guarantees is that stopping between the two costs
nothing.

== Time-varying values and occurrences
<time-varying-values-and-occurrences>
The designer sees two kinds of temporal thing. A quantity such as tilt
or temperature has a value whenever its domain is active. An occurrence
such as “button pressed” or “pickup detected” may or may not be present
at an activation, optionally with a payload.

The surface may display these differently, because they invite different
operations. A quantity is mapped, compared, and held; an occurrence is
counted, latched, and used to enter a context. Underneath, the
distinction is not one of type. Every declaration is a stream under the
tick semantics, and an occurrence is a declaration of optional type.
Within a single clock domain that is the whole story. Across domains,
where several occurrences may fall between two observations, a buffered
transport is required, and it is derived from the same two primitives as
everything else temporal.

== Time as a modifier, not a waiting instruction
<time-as-a-modifier-not-a-waiting-instruction>
The surface language avoids `wait(300 ms)` as a primary construct
because `wait` suggests a suspended sequential thread. Instead, BDL uses
temporal modifiers that describe relationships:

- `p for 300 ms`\;
- `after e by 2 s`\;
- `while p`\;
- `until e`\;
- `since e`\;
- `once e`\;
- `every 1 s`\;
- `rise p`, `previous x`, `count e`, `hold x e`.

The designer expresses a temporal property; the elaborator emits the
declaration shape that carries the required state. Each of these is a
derived form over one kernel primitive. `previous`, `hold`, `count`,
`since`, `once`, `every`, and `rise` were each elaborated and run on a
concrete input trace; the duration-qualified forms `after`, `for`,
`while`, and `until` are compositions of these with comparisons and
activation and were not separately executed.

== Behavioral contexts
<behavioral-contexts>
A StateHandler is not a program-counter location. Its surface meaning
is:

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[Within this product context, these behavioral relationships are
active.]
]

A context may be activated by a condition, or entered by one occurrence
and left by another. It contains a local flow graph and nested contexts.
For example, a `Held` context may be active while the cup is not in
contact with the table. Inside it, a `Drinking` sub-context may activate
when tilt exceeds a semantic threshold.

Nested contexts form a tree, avoiding the need to flatten every
orthogonal concern into a Cartesian-product state machine. BDL still
borrows the established value of hierarchical state models
@harel1987statecharts, but the surface metaphor is a #emph[context
containing behavior], not a transition diagram that the user must
manually maintain.

StateHandler remains useful at the surface because it gives a name and a
boundary to a product context. In the cases examined here, however, that
boundary introduces no new execution mechanism. Activation is a Boolean
declaration, entry is its rising edge, local temporal state is a delayed
cell gated by activation and reset on entry, an inactive context
contributes a default, and choosing between the outputs of two contexts
is an ordinary conditional in the one declaration that drives the
output. The cases examined are condition-scoped activation, entry,
reset-on-entry state, inactive default, event-latched activation with
exit-wins, state-local output selection, and nested selection with an
output. Contexts that carry their own clock domain, and nesting across
independently clocked contexts, were not examined, and nothing here says
how they would elaborate.

== Physical outputs
<physical-outputs>
A design computes values; it does not move hardware. Physical effect
happens only through an explicit binding of one declaration to one named
physical output, such as a light channel or a motor. Where several
behaviors would influence the same output --- a safety override and an
interaction context, say --- they are combined by an ordinary
declaration that becomes the single driver of that output. The
combination rule, whether priority, blend, maximum, or clamp, is written
in the design, where it can be read, rather than resolved by a runtime
policy.

This replaces the request-and-policy model of an earlier draft of BDL.
The change is discussed in the section on physical outputs, where the
tested alternatives are shown either to duplicate the single-driver rule
or to move the conflict into a collector that must itself be a policy.

== Supplied computation blocks
<supplied-computation-blocks>
Some product behavior is genuinely easier to state as code than as a
diagram. Recursive filters, Kalman estimators, spectral transforms, and
self-tuning controllers are not clarified by being decomposed into wires
and formulas. BDL therefore admits computation blocks written in the
host language and linked into the generated implementation.

This is the interface across which an engineer supplies a designer with
a capability. Because authoring is signature-first, the request can
precede the implementation: the designer places
`?smooth : Distance -> Distance` and the signature is the specification
the engineer works against. The same interface is used by the standard
library that ships with the system, so that first-party components
cannot rely on facilities denied to third-party ones.

A supplied block is a pure function or a stateful transducer. It may not
drive an output. What the kernel can derive for a native mapping must
instead be declared for a supplied one: determinism, totality on
well-typed inputs, output range, properties relied upon downstream such
as monotonicity, worst-case state size, and the update rate it was
designed for. These declarations are validation obligations, not typing,
and the mechanism by which each is discharged is recorded with it. There
is no primitive for reusable stateful components; a component used in
several places is instantiated into fresh declarations by the
elaborator, because temporal state belongs to declarations rather than
to functions.

= Designer Interaction Model
<designer-interaction-model>
The previous section described what a designer sees. This one describes
what a designer does. It is written as the interaction architecture the
language implies, not as a report on an implemented tool: no editor
exists, and every statement about what a designer would find natural is
a hypothesis for the evaluation plan to test. The intention is
nonetheless concrete. A reader should be able to picture the workspace,
what it contains at each stage of a design, and what it says when
something is wrong.

The environment is meant to be closer to a behavioral CAD system than to
a visual programming IDE. The main canvas holds named product concepts,
the relationships between them, the contexts in which those
relationships apply, and the physical outputs the product finally
drives. Formulas, units, documentation, declared properties, clock
information, deployment bindings, and validation status live in a local
inspector attached to whatever is selected. Kernel machinery --- concept
identities, grants, dependency ranks, domain judgments, solver
predicates --- does not appear as ordinary vocabulary at all. It can be
reached through an explanation view, described at the end of this
section, but the designer is not expected to go there.

== A running scenario
<a-running-scenario>
Consider a table lamp that responds to being handled. When the lamp is
picked up and tilted, its brightness follows the tilt, so that a user
can dim it by tipping it. When it is set down, it holds the brightness
it last had. The lamp has a small heater in its base to keep a drink
warm, and a temperature sensor beside it; above a warning temperature
the lamp should pulse, and above a critical temperature the heater must
switch off regardless of anything else the lamp is doing. The product is
to run on an Arduino Nano, which will be chosen last.

This is small, but it exercises everything the interaction model has to
offer: relationships that are known before their formulas, a behavior
that depends on a context, history without explicit state, a safety
condition that competes with an interaction for the same output, two
quantities that update at very different rates, and a deployment step at
which the design meets a board.

== Starting from intent
<starting-from-intent>
The designer begins by naming the concepts the product is about: `Tilt`,
`Brightness`, `Temperature`, `Held`. None of these is a sensor or a
number. `Tilt` is the product's orientation as the designer means it,
not an accelerometer channel; `Brightness` is how bright the lamp is,
not a PWM duty. Creating a concept places it on the canvas and opens an
inspector where a description, an expected range, and a unit may be
written down --- or not.

The first relationship is drawn as an arrow from `Tilt` to `Brightness`.
The tool asks for nothing else. The arrow becomes a Mapping Block with
the signature `Tilt -> Brightness`, a default name that the designer
changes to `dimByTilt`, and an empty body. It is drawn distinctly ---
the editor may render it as a hole --- but not as an error. The design
now says that brightness depends on tilt, and says nothing about how.

That statement already does work. A second relationship can be drawn
from `dimByTilt` onward; a property such as “increasing in tilt” can be
recorded in the inspector; and a wire from `Tilt` directly to a
motor-angle concept, had there been one, would be refused. What the
designer can do next is unconstrained: attach a formula now, or leave it
and continue with the rest of the product. The inspector's status line
reads #emph[declared], and explains that the relationship is named and
typed, that other parts of the design may depend on it, and that a
definition is still to come.

This is the first answer to why one would use BDL rather than a node
editor or a statechart. In a node editor the arrow cannot exist without
something to compute; in a statechart the relationship is not a
first-class object at all. Here it is the primary object, and its
incompleteness is a state the tool understands.

== Refining a relationship locally
<refining-a-relationship-locally>
When the designer opens `dimByTilt`, the canvas does not change. A local
editor appears, offering a formula field, a curve to drag, a table of
example pairs to fill in and fit, or a reference to a supplied
component. Whichever is chosen, the result is a definition attached to
the same block; the surrounding canvas continues to show one arrow from
`Tilt` to `Brightness`, not the arithmetic inside it.

Suppose the designer sketches a curve: dim at rest, full brightness at
about sixty degrees, clamped. The inspector shows the fitted formula
alongside the curve, and shows the units it inferred: the input is an
angle, the output is a dimensionless level in $\[0\,1\]$. Because the
block's signature already promises `Brightness`, the designer writes a
scalar expression and the tool supplies the semantic wrapping; there is
no constructor to type. Had the designer instead written an expression
that divides tilt by a time, the inspector would object in the block's
own terms: #emph[this expression produces an angular rate, but this
block promises brightness]. The status line moves from #emph[declared]
to #emph[defined], and, once the definition checks, to
#emph[type-valid].

The formula is local detail. It matters that it is not another box on
the canvas, because the canvas is meant to remain a diagram of the
product's behavior, legible to someone who does not want to read
equations. A reviewer sees that brightness follows tilt; a designer who
wants the curve opens the block.

== Time and history
<time-and-history>
The lamp should hold its brightness when set down. The designer selects
the wire from `dimByTilt` to the light and adds the qualifier
`hold while not Held`. Nothing else is needed. There is no
previous-value variable to declare, no timer to reset, and no flag to
clear; the phrase is the whole of the temporal specification.

The same vocabulary covers the rest of the product's history. “Pulse
when warm” becomes a `Warm` condition and an `every 1 s` phrase on the
pulse. “The lamp has been picked up at least once since power-on” is
`once (rise Held)`. “Picked up more than three times in ten minutes” is
`count (rise Held) within 10 min > 3`. Each of these appears as an
annotation on a relationship or a condition, not as a node with state
inside it.

Two things do surface. Every held or delayed quantity has a value at the
first tick, and the tool asks for it --- what brightness does the lamp
show before it has ever been tilted? --- because that value is a product
decision, not an implementation default. And the status line, once
temporal phrases are present, reports #emph[temporally valid] when every
such initial value is given and no relationship depends instantaneously
on itself. A design in which the pulse rate depended on the pulse,
without any delay between them, would be reported at the loop, in the
names of the two relationships, with the suggestion to insert a
`previous`.

That these phrases are all shapes over one delay primitive, and that the
primitive reads a clock domain at its previous activation, is the
subject of the reactive section. The designer does not need to know it,
though the explanation view will show it.

== Contexts as places
<contexts-as-places>
The tilt behavior should only apply while the lamp is held. The designer
draws a context named `Held`, with its activation condition attached ---
the lamp is off the table --- and drags `dimByTilt` inside it. Visually
the block is now within a region; semantically, the relationship applies
while the region is active. A `Drinking` sub-context can be nested
inside `Held`, entered when tilt exceeds a threshold and left when it
falls back, and given its own behavior: a slower dimming curve, say.
There is no state-transition table to maintain and no product of states
to enumerate.

What the tool shows about a context is which relationships it contains,
what enters and leaves it, and what it contributes to each output while
active. Entry and exit conditions are ordinary occurrences, so
`rise Held` and the like are available. Contexts with local history
reset that history on entry unless the designer marks it persistent; the
inspector states which.

The reduction of all this to plain declarations --- an activation, an
entry edge, gated state, a conditional in the output --- is not
something the designer manipulates. It is what the explanation view
shows and what the reactive section justifies for the cases that were
examined. Contexts with their own clocks are outside those cases, and
the tool should say so rather than elaborate them silently.

== One output, one final target
<one-output-one-final-target>
The lamp's light is a physical output. The designer connects `dimByTilt`
(inside `Held`) to it. Then the warning behavior is built: a `Warm`
condition on `Temperature`, and a pulsing brightness while it holds. The
natural next action is to connect that pulse to the light as well.

The tool declines. The message is not #emph[single-driver violation]. It
reads, on the light output, along the lines of #emph[this output already
has a final driver, `dimByTilt`\; combine the two brightness values
before connecting the output]. The reason is a product reason: two
behaviors that both set the same light have no defined result, and any
rule the runtime picked --- last wins, highest wins, the one drawn first
--- would be a decision made silently on the designer's behalf.

The repaired design has one more block:

```text
dimByTilt (in Held) ----\
                         -> lampTarget -> light
warmPulse (while Warm) -/
```

`lampTarget : Brightness` is an ordinary Mapping Block whose definition
states the rule. It might say that the pulse takes priority while
`Warm`, or that the two are multiplied, or that the maximum is shown.
The critical cutoff is handled the same way: `heaterTarget` takes the
heater's demand from wherever it comes and forces it to zero above the
critical temperature. The override is visible as a block on the canvas,
upstream of the output, rather than as a policy attached to a context.
When the designer later asks why the heater is off, the answer is on the
canvas.

The status line on an output reads #emph[output-complete] when exactly
one final target drives it, and reports each undriven output the product
requires until then.

== Values that move at different speeds
<values-that-move-at-different-speeds>
The temperature sensor updates once a second. Tilt updates fifty times a
second. The designer records this not as two rates but as two
#emph[domains]: `Temperature` moves with the environment, `Tilt` and
`Held` move with the interaction. Domains are declared by name on the
concept, and at this stage no rate is attached to either.

The first time a relationship reads across the boundary ---
`heaterTarget`, in the interaction domain, reads the
critical-temperature condition from the ambient domain --- the tool
stops at that wire. Again the message is not a judgment name. It says
that the two values update in different domains, and asks how the reader
should see the source: as the last value the source produced, with a
stated value to use before the source has ever reported, or by moving
the reader into the source's domain and accepting a slower response.
Both are legitimate designs. Choosing the first adds a visible transport
on the wire, and the initial value it asks for --- is the heater
interlock engaged or released before the first temperature reading? ---
is exactly the kind of decision that ought to be written down for a
safety condition. The status line reports #emph[clock-consistent] when
every crossing has been settled this way.

Rates are attached at deployment. Changing a rate later changes what the
product does, and the tool will re-run any timing obligations, but it
changes nothing about which relationships are valid. Moving a concept
from one domain to another does, and the tool treats that as an edit: it
reopens every relationship that read the concept.

== Choosing a board
<choosing-a-board>
Until this point the design has said nothing about hardware. The
physical outputs are named --- `light`, `heater` --- and each has a
kind: the light is a PWM channel, the heater is a switched load. The
sensors are declared by kind too: the tilt estimate comes from an
inertial sensor on the I2C bus, the temperature from an analog input.

Selecting an Arduino Nano in the deployment panel derives, from those
kinds, what the design needs from a board --- one PWM line, one digital
output, two bus lines on the same I2C unit, one analog input --- and
attempts to place them. For the lamp this succeeds immediately, and the
panel proposes an allocation: the light on a PWM pin, the heater on a
digital pin, the sensor on the two I2C pins. The designer may accept it,
or pin a requirement by hand --- the light on D3, because that is where
the board's connector is --- and let the rest be placed around it. A
manual pin is a constraint on deployment, not a change to the design:
nothing on the canvas moves.

The shape of a conflict is easier to see on a larger design, and the
case examined in the development is the one to picture. A product with
four motor channels, each an H-bridge needing a PWM line and a direction
line, and an inertial sensor on I2C, fits the Nano; the allocation the
solver produced is
`M1 -> D3/D0, M2 -> D5/D1, M3 -> D6/D2, M4 -> D9/D4, IMU -> A4/A5`. A
product needing seven independently dimmed channels does not fit,
because the Nano has six PWM pins. The behavioral design is untouched by
this; nothing on the canvas turns red. The deployment panel reports, on
the seventh channel, that seven PWM lines are required and six are
available, and names for each PWM pin the channel occupying it. A
designer who then selects a larger board sees the same design placed
without change. A designer who pins a PWM channel to D3 and later adds a
rotary encoder that needs D3 as an interrupt line is told, on the
encoder, that the only remaining interrupt pin is held by a manual
assignment.

The distinction the panel is built to keep visible is that a design can
be entirely valid --- typed, temporally sound, every output driven ---
and still not fit the chosen board. The two are reported in different
places and worded differently, so that neither is mistaken for the
other.

== What the workspace says at each stage
<what-the-workspace-says-at-each-stage>
@fig:levels lists the states a design passes through. They are not a row
of compiler badges. Each is meant to answer three questions about the
selected object: what remains unresolved, what is already settled, and
what can be done next.

  caption: [States a design passes through, as the workspace reports them. All but the last are properties of the design alone; the last is a property of the design together with a board, and is re-established whenever either changes.],
) <fig:levels>
A relationship that is declared but not defined is not flagged as wrong;
it is shown as open, and the design around it is checked as far as it
can be. A relationship that is defined but not type-valid is flagged at
the definition, in the vocabulary of the block. A loop or a missing
initial value is flagged at the wire. A missing final target is flagged
at the output. A conflict on the board is flagged in the deployment
panel, on the requirement that could not be placed.

Two states deserve their own visibility. #emph[Hardware-feasible] is
separate from everything above it, because it is the only state that
depends on something other than the design, and it is re-established
from scratch when the board changes or the design grows; six channels
fit, a seventh may not, and nothing about the first six changes. And a
property discharged because a supplied component's author asserted it is
not shown the way a property the tool computed is shown. A latency bound
that rests on a declared worst-case execution time is weaker than one
derived from the design, and the two must not look alike.

== Looking underneath
<looking-underneath>
Most of the time the compact surface is all a designer sees. When
behavior is surprising --- the lamp pulses once more than expected, or
the heater takes a second longer than expected to cut off --- an
explanation view opens the selected object to show what it became. For
`hold while not Held` it shows the held value as a delayed cell and the
condition that gates it. For a context it shows the activation, the
entry edge, and the reset. For a cross-domain wire it shows the
transport and the tick at which the source was last read, which is where
the extra second lives. For an output it shows the final target and,
once a board is chosen, the requirements derived from the output's kind
and the pins they were given.

This view is the answer to the hidden-elaboration risk noted in the
discussion. The surface stays simple because elaboration does real work;
the explanation view exists so that the work is inspectable rather than
mysterious. It is also where the kernel vocabulary is allowed to appear,
for an engineer who receives the design and wants to know exactly what
was generated.

== The workflow as a whole
<the-workflow-as-a-whole>
Read end to end, the intended sequence is this. The designer names the
concepts the product is about and draws the relationships between them,
leaving each undefined until there is something to say. Relationships
are refined locally, by formula, curve, examples, or a supplied
component, without the canvas changing shape. Time and history are
stated as qualifiers on relationships. Contexts give a name and a
boundary to the situations in which behaviors apply, and are nested
rather than multiplied. Where two behaviors reach for one output, the
tool asks for one final target, and the rule that combines them becomes
a visible block. Where two quantities move at different speeds, the tool
asks how one should see the other, and the answer becomes a visible
transport with a stated initial value. Only then is a board chosen; the
design's needs are derived from the kinds of its inputs and outputs, an
allocation is proposed or a conflict is reported, manual pins are
honoured, and switching boards re-solves the same needs without touching
the design. Throughout, the workspace reports what is settled and what
is open, and keeps a design that is valid distinct from a design that is
deployable.

Whether designers work this way when given the chance, and whether it
helps them, are the questions the evaluation plan is written to answer.

architectural result of the formal development.

  caption: [The three layers. Typing consults only the type view of declarations and the representation view of concepts; validation may consult commitments, evidence, and the target; the surface is derived forms over the kernel.],
) <fig:arch>
The #strong[surface] is what the designer authors: semantic properties,
Mapping Blocks, temporal modifiers, contexts, device bindings, units,
and display names. Everything in it elaborates to kernel objects, and
the elaboration is one-directional: the kernel never needs to recover
surface structure.

The #strong[kernel] is the formal object of this paper. It consists of
an environment of declarations, a typing judgment, a tick-indexed
evaluation relation over one or several clock domains, a domain
judgment, and a small number of global well-formedness conditions: every
realization satisfies its interface, the instantaneous dependency graph
is acyclic, every reference respects domains, and every physical output
has at most one driver. The typing judgment reads only the #emph[type
view] of declarations --- their expected types --- and the
#emph[representation view] of concepts. It does not read realizations,
commitments, evidence, clocks, or bindings.

The #strong[validation layer] is everything that may depend on more than
types. It discharges the commitments a declaration makes, and it decides
whether a design fits a target board. Two kinds of evidence live here
and are kept apart. Evidence that is meant to survive refinement --- a
monotonicity commitment discharged compositionally through the
commitments of other declarations --- must be stable under monotone
extension of the environment, and the kernel imposes that condition.
Evidence that is not meant to survive refinement --- the existence of a
pin assignment on a particular board --- is re-established after every
change and is never merged with the first kind.

@fig:arch shows the layers. What is notable about the arrangement is how
much of the earlier draft of BDL is absent from the kernel band.
Reactive types, event types, effect rows, action requests, policy
transformations, and a five-phase tick with a resolve step were all part
of the draft kernel. Each was removed because it either added no
rejection the smaller kernel lacked, or made a design decision on the
designer's behalf that should have been visible in the design. The
states of @fig:levels are the designer-facing face of the same
structure: #emph[declared] and #emph[type-valid] are the typing judgment
and satisfaction; #emph[temporally valid] is causality;
#emph[clock-consistent] is the domain judgment; #emph[output-complete]
is the single-driver and completeness conditions;
#emph[hardware-feasible] is the validation layer's solver. Each is
decidable for finite designs.

= Declarations, Interfaces, and Refinement
<declarations-interfaces-and-refinement>
The foundational kernel object is a #strong[design declaration],

$ upright("DesignDecl") = chevron.l thick & italic(i d) : upright("DeclId")\,\
 & italic(i n t e r f a c e) : upright("DeclInterface")\,\
 & italic(r e a l i z a t i o n) : upright("Option") thick upright("Expr") thick chevron.r\, $

where an interface is an expected type together with a set of public
commitments:

$ upright("DeclInterface") = chevron.l thick & italic(e x p e c t e d T y p e) : upright("Ty")\,\
 & italic(c o m m i t m e n t s) : upright("PropertyId")^(*) thick chevron.r . $

A design is an environment
$Delta : upright("DeclId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("DesignDecl")$.
An unresolved declaration is one whose realization is `none`\; nothing
else distinguishes it. Display names are not part of the kernel.

== Typing through the type view
<typing-through-the-type-view>
Terms refer to declarations by identity, $upright("declRef") thick d$.
The typing judgment $Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r e : tau$ takes a
concept environment $Theta$ and a grant $G$, both introduced in the next
section, and a declaration environment $Delta$ which it consults through
exactly one projection, the type view $Delta^(upright(t y))\(d\)$, the
expected type of $d$ if declared:

$ frac(Delta^(upright(t y))\(d\)= upright("some") thick tau, Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r upright("declRef") thick d : tau) . $

This is the only rule that reads $Delta$. A client of $d$ is therefore
typed against $d$'s interface and never against its body, whether or not
a body exists. Inference is syntax-directed and decidable, and an
inference function is proved sound, complete, and unique against the
judgment.

== Satisfaction, well-formedness, and refinement
<satisfaction-well-formedness-and-refinement>
A realization $e$ #strong[satisfies] an interface $S$ when it has the
expected type under the grant of that type and discharges every
commitment:

$  & upright("Satisfies") thick italic(e v) thick Theta thick Delta thick Gamma thick e thick S thick :=\
 & quad Theta\;Delta\;upright("Grant.of")\(S . italic(t y)\)\;Gamma tack.r e : S . italic(t y)\
 & quad and thick forall p in S . italic(c o m m i t m e n t s) . thick italic(e v) thick Delta thick e thick p\, $

where $S . italic(t y)$ abbreviates the expected type. Here
$italic(e v) : upright("DeclEnv") arrow.r upright("Expr") arrow.r upright("PropertyId") arrow.r upright("Prop")$
is an abstract #strong[evidence] relation supplied by the validation
layer. It takes the environment as an argument because compositional
discharge needs it: “$A$ is monotone because $B$ is committed to be
monotone” consults $B$'s interface. A design is #strong[globally well
formed] when every stored declaration sits under its own identity and
its realization, if any, satisfies its interface in that design.

Interfaces are ordered by monotone refinement: $S subset.eq.sq S'$ when
the expected type is unchanged and the commitments of $S$ are contained
in those of $S'$. A declaration takes a refinement step in one of three
ways. An unresolved declaration may have its interface refined; an
unresolved declaration may be realized with a satisfying body; and a
realized declaration may have its interface strengthened, provided the
body is re-verified against the new interface. The reflexive-transitive
closure of these steps is exactly the structural order together with
well-formedness of the target, where the structural order
$upright("DeclLeq")$ requires the same identity, interface refinement,
and a write-once realization, and
$upright("EnvRefines") thick Delta_1 thick Delta_2$ lifts it pointwise
while permitting new declarations.

== Client stability
<client-stability>
Can a declaration be refined or realized without editing its clients,
and without invalidating what was previously established about them? The
answer has two halves with deliberately different hypotheses.

The typing half needs only the structural order. If $B$ is declared in
$Delta$ and $upright("DeclLeq") thick B thick B'$, then every typing
judgment in $Delta$ holds in $Delta\[B'\]$. This is a one-line
consequence of typing references through the type view, and it should be
read as such: its content is that the decision to let clients see
interfaces and never bodies is #emph[sufficient] for client stability.
It is also necessary. Change $B$'s expected type while keeping its
identity, and every client breaks.

The commitment half needs more. If $Delta$ is globally well formed, $B$
takes a refinement step whose side conditions are checked in $Delta$,
and the evidence relation is #strong[monotone] --- stable under
$upright("EnvRefines")$ --- then $Delta\[B'\]$ is globally well formed,
and the same holds for a whole lifecycle of $B$ checked against the
original environment. The monotonicity hypothesis was not part of the
original design. It appeared when the theorem was attacked. An evidence
relation that consults the #emph[absence] of information --- one that
discharges a property because a dependency is still unresolved, say ---
is destroyed by a perfectly valid realization step, and the
non-monotonicity of that evidence can be derived from the failure of
preservation. Any discharge mechanism intended to survive refinement
must therefore be positive in the environment.

== Refinement versus edit
<refinement-versus-edit>
The preservation theorems cover refinement only. The table lists the
operations examined and their classification; each row is witnessed by
an example on a two-declaration design in which
$A : upright("nat") arrow.r upright("bool")$ is realized through an
unresolved $B : upright("nat") arrow.r upright("nat")$.

#block(width: 100%)[
#set text(size: 7.3pt)
#table(
  columns: (1.15fr, 0.7fr, 1.35fr), align: left, inset: (x: 3pt, y: 2.6pt),
  stroke: (x: none, y: 0.3pt),
  table.header([*Operation on $B$*], [*Kind*], [*Effect on $A$*]),
  [add a public commitment], [refinement], [typing and commitments preserved],
  [realize], [refinement], [preserved; $A$ now unfolds to a closed program],
  [strengthen a realized interface], [refinement, with re-verification], [preserved],
  [change the expected type, keep identity], [edit], [typing broken],
  [drop a commitment], [edit], [typing silent; $A$'s commitment broken],
  [replace $B$ by a new identity], [edit], [dangling reference],
  [add a new $B'$ beside $B$], [edit], [$A$ still depends on the stale $B$; never executable],
  [detach or replace the realization], [edit], [evidence that consulted the body is void],
  [assign or change a clock domain], [edit], [domain judgment on clients broken],
  [retarget an output binding], [edit], [completeness or single-driver may break],
)
]
Two rows deserve comment. Dropping a commitment changes no type, so the
type checker is silent, yet $A$'s own commitment was discharged through
$B$'s and is now unsupported. Commitments are therefore part of the
interface in the same load-bearing sense as the expected type. That is a
stronger position than the earlier draft of this paper took when it
described properties as merely attaching to a name. Detaching a
realization, which that draft permitted as an ordinary operation, is an
edit for the same reason: clients' typing is unaffected, but any
evidence that consulted the body is void. The kernel does not forbid
edits. It declines to promise anything about them, and the tool must
reopen the validation of transitive dependents.

== What persistent identity is
<what-persistent-identity-is>
The earlier draft left open whether a persistent, referable identity for
an unresolved relationship is a novel abstraction. It is not. Every
theorem that mentions identity uses it only to make an update land on
the slot a reference resolves to, which is what a name does in any
environment-based semantics. The non-trivial content lies in the
environment order, and in the two facts that clients depend on it only
through the type view for typing and only through monotone evidence for
commitments. This is the familiar interface/implementation separation of
module signatures, of a parameter later given a definition, or of a
metavariable context with write-once assignment and fixed types,
together with a Kripke-style stability condition on evidence. What is
slightly non-standard is that the interface carries a growable
commitment set whose growth is a first-class operation on a
declared-but-undefined name, and that the kernel imposes a stability
condition on the validation layer. Neither is a new type-theoretic
mechanism, and the paper does not claim one.

= Semantic Identity and Representation
<semantic-identity-and-representation>
== Nominal concepts
<nominal-concepts>
Suppose concepts were represented only by their representation types, so
that `Tilt` and `MotorAngle` are both numbers. Then the wire
`motorTarget := tiltSensor` is well typed and the design is globally
well formed, because nothing in the model records the distinction. This
baseline was built, the wire was accepted, and three ways of recording
the distinction were then tried against it.

The one that survived is a single nominal type constructor over an
internal identity:

$ upright("SemanticId")\,#h(2em) upright("Ty") in.rev upright("sem") thick s . $

Two distinct identities are distinct types regardless of representation,
so the invalid wire is rejected by the ordinary rules of the simply
typed calculus with no additional judgment. An explicit relationship
between concepts, `tiltToMotor : Tilt -> MotorAngle`, is an ordinary
declaration of arrow type --- a design relationship that is itself
signature-first and may remain unresolved --- and it appears in the term
wherever a crossing occurs. It is not a cast, coercion, or conversion;
the kernel has no such mechanism.

Semantic identity is independent of declaration identity, of display
name, of dimension, and of hardware, and each independence was tested
rather than assumed. A rename preserves identity, whereas a model in
which the name #emph[is] the identity makes renaming destructive.
Treating a concept as an ordinary declaration admits two category
errors: the concept becomes usable as a value, and it can be realized by
a number. Keeping identity out of the type as interface metadata,
checked by a direct-wire rule, is evaded by $eta$-expansion, since
`(λx. x) tilt` has the same flow with no direct wire. A compositional
role judgment strong enough to close that gap has the rule shapes of
typing over types-with-`sem`, and the one such formulation examined
duplicated nominal typing without benefit. Flow-sensitive or relational
semantic analyses were not formalized and are not ruled out; nominal
`sem` is the smallest mechanism among the designs that were tried, not
the only one possible.

Erasing all semantic identities is sound --- a well-typed semantic term
is well typed at its representation --- and the baseline is exactly what
erasure leaves. Generated code is thus ordinary code; the semantic layer
has no runtime residue.

== Representation binding and the grant
<representation-binding-and-the-grant>
Nominal identity alone leaves semantic values opaque. Without a way to
observe a representation and construct a value, no mapping can be
realized by a formula; under nominal typing alone a semantic value can
only originate from a declaration of semantic type. That is the right
state before representation is added. The question is how to add it
without destroying what identity just bought.

The obvious form --- global
$upright("rep")_s : upright("sem") thick s arrow.r R$ and
$upright("mk")_s : R arrow.r upright("sem") thick s$ available to every
term --- destroys it immediately.
$lambda x . thick upright("mk")_(upright("Motor"))\(upright("rep")_(upright("Tilt")) thick x\)$
is a well-typed `Tilt -> MotorAngle` in the empty environment, with no
declaration and no mapping; a motor angle can be manufactured from a
literal; and the crossing can hide inside a body whose signature
mentions no motor. Observation alone, with no construction, is safe but
cannot realize a mapping. The surviving model separates the two:

- a #strong[concept environment]
  $Theta : upright("SemanticId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("Ty")$
  binds each concept, write-once, to a representation that mentions no
  semantic type and contains no function type;
- $upright("rep") thick e$ is typed at $R$ whenever
  $e : upright("sem") thick s$ and
  $Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R$, everywhere;
- $upright("mk") thick s thick e$ is typed at $upright("sem") thick s$
  whenever $e : R$, $Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R$, #emph[and
  the grant permits $s$].

$ frac(Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R quad Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r e : upright("sem") thick s, Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r upright("rep") thick e : R) $

$ frac(G thick s quad Theta thick s = upright("some") thick R quad Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r e : R, Theta\;Delta\;G\;Gamma tack.r upright("mk") thick s thick e : upright("sem") thick s) $

The grant $G$ is a predicate on concepts. Client code is typed under the
empty grant. The realization of a declaration is typed under
$upright("Grant.of")\(tau\)$, the concepts in result position of its own
signature $tau$. A value of `MotorAngle` can therefore be constructed
only inside a declaration that announces `MotorAngle` in its signature,
which is exactly where a reader of the design would look for it. A
well-typed term constructs $s$ only where granted $s$\; the hidden
crossing above is rejected under the grant of an unrelated declaration
and becomes legal, and visible, once `tiltToMotor` is declared; binding
an unbound concept is monotone for typing, satisfaction, and global
well-formedness; and rebinding a concept to a different representation
is an edit that breaks existing realizations.

Two constraints on the representation were not anticipated.
Representation types must be free of semantic types, because if `Tilt`
may be represented #emph[by] `MotorAngle` then `rep` itself is a hidden
mapping under every policy, including observation-only. And they must be
data types, a requirement that arrived later from the reactive
semantics: a semantic value may be delayed, and a function-typed
representation would carry a closure across ticks.

The grant is a known shape --- a capability attached to a definition
site, or equivalently the private constructor of an abstract type
exported only to the module that declares it. Its contribution here is
where the capability comes from: the signature the designer already
wrote, so no annotation is added. The paper does not present it as a
capability calculus. One consequence should be stated plainly. After all
bodies are inlined into one executable program, that program is checked
under the universal grant, because each construction was authorized at
its own declaration. Semantic isolation is a property of the design
graph and survives inlining as provenance, not as a type property of the
executable.

== Physical dimensions
<physical-dimensions>
Physical quantities have type $upright("q") thick d$ for a dimension
$d$, an exponent vector over a small set of base dimensions. There is no
dimension-specific typing rule; the algebra lives entirely in the types
of registered primitive operators,

$ upright("add")_d & : upright("q") thick d arrow.r upright("q") thick d arrow.r upright("q") thick d\,\
upright("mul")_(d_1 d_2) & : upright("q") thick d_1 arrow.r upright("q") thick d_2 arrow.r upright("q") thick\(d_1 + d_2\)\,\
upright("div")_(d_1 d_2) & : upright("q") thick d_1 arrow.r upright("q") thick d_2 arrow.r upright("q") thick\(d_1 - d_2\)\, $

and an application is checked by ordinary function application. Erasing
every dimension to the zero vector is sound and accepts `length + time`,
so the untyped numeric baseline is the erasure of dimensional typing in
the same sense that the representation baseline is the erasure of
nominal typing. Dimensions might instead have been validation metadata;
the argument against is that multiplication and division #emph[produce]
dimensions, so any checker recomputes the same inference, but that
family was argued against rather than excluded.

Dimension and semantic identity are orthogonal. `Tilt` and `MotorAngle`
both bound to `q Angle` remain distinct types. A mapping realized by the
dimensioned formula `λx. mk bright (rep x · gain)` with
`gain : q (0 − Angle)` is typed; a dimension error inside the formula is
caught by the same typing; and the formula cannot manufacture a
`MotorAngle` despite the shared dimension. The association between a
concept and its dimension lives in $Theta$, not in the identity and not
in the type constructor. The earlier draft's two-index
$upright("Sem")\[n\,d\]$ becomes $upright("sem") thick s$ together with
$Theta thick s = upright("some") thick\(upright("q") thick d\)$.

Units are surface. A literal `n u` elaborates to a dimensioned literal
scaled by the unit's factor; changing the unit changes the value, never
the type, and mixed-unit addition works after elaboration. Expressing a
quantity in a unit --- its #emph[coordinate] --- and building a quantity
from a coordinate are the same arithmetic against a unit constant:
`inUnit(q, u)` is `q` divided by the unit's scale and has dimension
zero, `withUnit(x, u)` is `x` times the scale and has the unit's
dimension, and a conversion between two units is their composition; each
is elaborated, none is a kernel construct, and a unit choice never
reaches a type (`1 m` and `100 cm` are equal values of one type). The
unit laws --- round trips, derived conversion, dimension safety --- are
proved over an abstract scalar domain and instantiated by a symbolic
group in which `π` is a generator, so that a degree is exactly `π/180`
radian; the executable kernel truncates to naturals and production
approximates in floating point. A preferred display unit is
presentation: it changes the number shown and no judgment of the design.
Affine scales such as degrees Celsius are not linear (`0 °C` is
`273.15 K`), yet their literals and coordinates elaborate exactly by
adding an offset. Unit coordinates erase chart identity while preserving
affine coordinate change: the conversion between two charts is an affine
map, conversions compose and invert --- compatible charts are isomorphic
coordinate systems --- and differences inherit the linear part of that
transformation, so a difference of ten degrees Celsius is eighteen
degrees Fahrenheit from any base point, while a conversion with a
non-zero offset is not an additive homomorphism. The same abstraction
covers sensor calibration and encoder offsets. These laws are proved
over an abstract field and instantiated exactly at rationals; production
floating point is held to a toleranced version of them. Whether a sum of
two absolute temperatures should be permitted is a separate, optional
validation question that the dimension does not decide and conversion
does not need.

= A Minimal Reactive Semantics
<a-minimal-reactive-semantics>
== One primitive
<one-primitive>
The reactive kernel adds one expression form and no types:

$ upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e . $

Its meaning is given by a tick-indexed big-step evaluation relation
$upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick t thick rho thick e thick v$:
the value of $e$ at tick $t$ under a local environment $rho$, where
$I : upright("DeclId") arrow.r bb(N) arrow.r upright("Value")$ supplies
the inputs. Every declaration is a stream by interpretation. An
unresolved declaration is an input and takes its value from $I$\; a
realized declaration is evaluated from its body at the current tick;
$upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e$ evaluates $e$ at tick
$t$ when read at tick $t + 1$, and $italic(i n i t)$ at tick $0$:

$ frac(Delta^(upright(r e a l))\(d\)= upright("none"), upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick t thick rho thick\(upright("declRef") thick d\)thick\(I thick d thick t\)) $

$ frac(upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick 0 thick rho thick italic(i n i t) thick v, upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick 0 thick rho thick\(upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) #h(2em) frac(upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick t thick rho thick e thick v, upright("Ev") thick Delta thick I thick\(t + 1\)thick rho thick\(upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) . $

There is no signal type in $upright("Ty")$. Under this semantics a
signal type would be inhabited by exactly the terms of the underlying
type and would reject nothing. The information a reactive type would
carry in a multi-domain setting is #emph[which clock], and the next
section places that information in a judgment rather than a type. There
is likewise no event type. Within one domain an input delivers at most
one value per tick by construction, so an occurrence is a stream of
optional type, and the streams of type $upright("opt") thick tau$ are
exactly the streams of multiplicity at most one. What separates an
occurrence from an optional value --- two occurrences falling in one
observation interval --- can only be seen when a source ticks faster
than its observer. That is a cross-domain question and is treated there.

Two restrictions on $upright("delay")$ were forced by the totality proof
rather than chosen. The delayed type must be a #strong[data] type, one
with no function type inside, because a delayed closure would have to
persist across ticks and the logical relation for closures is
tick-indexed and cannot be transported. And $upright("delay")$ may occur
only at #strong[top level], under no binder, because a delay under a
lambda would re-evaluate its operand at the previous tick in an
environment created at the current tick. Temporal state therefore
belongs to declarations, and mappings are pointwise. This is the
arrangement of `pre` in Lustre, where it lives in nodes rather than in
functions @halbwachs1991lustre, and its practical consequence is that a
reusable stateful component is instantiated into fresh declarations
rather than abstracted over.

== Causality
<causality>
The dependency graph on declarations comes in three variants. Structural
dependency, $upright("DependsOn")$, records every reference in a body.
Instantaneous dependency, $upright("InstDependsOn")$, excludes
references under the delayed operand of a $upright("delay")$ (the
initial value is read at tick $0$ and counts as instantaneous). A design
is #strong[causal] when its instantaneous graph is acyclic, witnessed by
a bounded rank:

$ upright("Causal") thick Delta thick := thick exists thin italic(r a n k)\,R . thick & \(forall d . thick italic(r a n k) thick d < R\)thick and\
forall a thin b . thick & upright("InstDependsOn") thick Delta thick a thick b arrow.r italic(r a n k) thick b < italic(r a n k) thick a . $

On the delay-free fragment this coincides with structural acyclicity, so
the earlier acyclicity condition is the timeless special case rather
than a replaced requirement. A structural cycle every one of whose paths
passes through a delayed operand --- `A := delay 0 B; B := A`, or a
self-delayed accumulator --- is causal and runs at every tick. A cycle
that is partly delayed is not causal. A strict cycle, one through
neither a delay nor a lambda, has no value at any tick.

Evaluation is a partial function: one tick, one environment, one term,
at most one value, with no hidden evaluation order, and this holds
unconditionally. It is total on causal designs: if $Delta$ is causal and
globally well formed and the inputs are well typed, every declaration
has a value at every tick, related to its type by a logical relation, by
an induction on tick, rank, and derivation. An executable interpreter is
proved sound for the relation, and every trace reported in this paper
was obtained by running it.

One gap should be recorded. A cycle guarded by a lambda, `A := λx. A x`,
is rejected by $upright("Causal")$, yet `declRef A` does evaluate --- to
a closure; only applying it diverges. $upright("Causal")$ is
conservative for lambda-guarded cycles, and the negative theorem covers
strict cycles only.

== Derived operators
<derived-operators>
Every temporal operator of the surface language reduces to
$upright("delay")$ and the primitive operators. There is no independent
kernel definition of `count` for the reduction to be proved equivalent
to; what was done instead was to elaborate each operator, check its
typing and causality, and run it on a concrete input trace. In each row
the declaration refers to itself. Each is a self-delayed cycle, the
class that structural acyclicity forbade and causality licenses.

#block(width: 100%)[
#set text(size: 7.3pt)
#table(
  columns: (0.9fr, 1.6fr), align: left, inset: (x: 3pt, y: 2.6pt),
  stroke: (x: none, y: 0.3pt),
  table.header([*Surface*], [*Declaration shape*]),
  [`previous x`], [`delay init x`],
  [`previous x` without init], [`delay none (some x)`; the absence is pushed to consumers],
  [`hold init e`], [`getD e (delay init self)`],
  [`count e`], [`ite (isSome e) (1 + delay 0 self) (delay 0 self)`],
  [`since e`], [`ite (isSome e) 0 (1 + delay 0 self)`],
  [`once e`], [`delay false self ∨ isSome e`],
  [`every n`], [modulo-$n$ counter over `delay`],
  [`rise b`], [`b ∧ ¬ delay false b`, as an optional Boolean],
)
]
State has no identity of its own. A cell is a $upright("delay")$ in a
declaration body, and nothing refers to it because consumers refer to
the declaration. There is consequently no notion of two writers to one
cell in this kernel.

State preserves semantic identity and dimension. The typing rule is
$upright("delay") : tau arrow.r tau arrow.r tau$ for data $tau$, so a
delayed tilt is a tilt and a backward difference over a time step has
dimension $upright("Length") - upright("Time")$ with no derivative
primitive. Provenance holds in the reactive setting too: if no signature
announces a concept and no input carries it, no value at any tick
carries it. Temporal state carries tags; it never creates them.

Initialization is semantic, not validation. Every $upright("delay")$
carries an explicit initial value. Two toy relations without one show
why: the first tick is either undefined or nondeterministic. Adding or
removing a delay, or changing an initial value, is an edit.

= Clock Domains
<clock-domains>
== Identity, not rate
<identity-not-rate>
“Contact and orientation move with the interaction; temperature moves
with the environment.” A designer can say this before any rate is known,
and it is a statement about which quantities are updated together, not
about how often. BDL records it as a nominal #strong[clock domain],
$upright("ClockId")$, and treats rate as validation data that never
enters the kernel.

The time model is one global base tick and a schedule
$S : upright("ClockId") arrow.r bb(N) arrow.r upright("Bool")$ saying at
which global ticks each domain activates. A period $n$ induces the
schedule $t med mod med n = 0$\; the schedule lives outside the design.
Domain-local time is not a separate counter but the sequence of a
domain's activations.

Each non-agnostic declaration is assigned a domain by a #strong[clock
environment]
$upright(K) : upright("DeclId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("ClockId")$\;
a declaration with no domain is a pure mapping that may serve any
domain. The clock is interface data in every sense that matters ---
clients' validity depends on it, it is frozen under refinement, and
changing it is an edit --- and it is stored as a projection beside the
interface, exactly as a concept's representation is stored in $Theta$
rather than in the type. Whether to fold it into the interface record is
churn rather than semantics.

Rate and identity are distinct. A clone of a domain with the identical
schedule is a different domain, and a direct wire between them is
rejected; a domain at the same rate but shifted in phase reads different
values through a transport. Rate changes are validation-only. They
change the induced schedule and hence the observed values, but no
client's well-formedness. This is where BDL departs from synchronous
languages that recover clocks by inference @colaco2003clocks. The domain
is authored, because the information needed to infer it does not arrive
until realization binding, which in this workflow is the point at which
the designer is least able to make the decision.

== One transport primitive
<one-transport-primitive>
Cross-domain reading is the second and last temporal form:

$ upright("sync") thick c thick italic(i n i t) thick e\, $

the value of $e$, evaluated in domain $c$, at the last activation of $c$
strictly before the current tick, and $italic(i n i t)$ if there has
been none. The multi-domain evaluation relation
$upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick e thick v$
indexes evaluation by the domain in which it takes place, and its two
transport rules are

$ frac(upright("prevAct") thick S thick c' thick t = upright("none") quad upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick italic(i n i t) thick v, upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick\(upright("sync") thick c' thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) $

$ frac(upright("prevAct") thick S thick c' thick t = upright("some") thick t' quad upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c' thick t' thick rho thick e thick v, upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick c thick t thick rho thick\(upright("sync") thick c' thick italic(i n i t) thick e\)thick v) . $

$upright("delay")$ is $upright("sync")$ at the expression's own domain:
$upright("delay") thick italic(i n i t) thick e equiv upright("sync") thick c thick italic(i n i t) thick e$
in domain $c$, as an equivalence of the two relations. The kernel
therefore has one temporal primitive --- read a domain at its previous
activation --- and the single-domain semantics of the previous section
is its diagonal. Under the always-active schedule, $upright("MEv")$
coincides with $upright("Ev")$ in every domain, so the earlier results
are the one-domain special case rather than a replaced machine. A
`delay` in a slow domain reads three global ticks back where a `delay`
in a fast one reads one, with the same syntax.

A #strong[domain judgment]
$upright("Clocked") thick upright(K) thick c thick e$ rejects every
other cross-domain reference: a reference stays in its domain or is
agnostic, a delay needs a domain, and $upright("sync") thick c'$
switches the domain of its operand. Typing is unchanged and is blind to
domains; the direct wire between two domains at the same value type is
well typed and rejected only by the domain judgment. Placing the domain
in the type instead was tried and set aside. Every pure mapping would
need clock polymorphism, and nothing the type rejects is missed by the
judgment.

== Strictly before
<strictly-before>
A transport sees only source activations strictly before the destination
tick. That is a choice with an observable alternative, and the
alternative was built. A transport that lets simultaneously active
domains see each other's current values makes the scheduler order
observable: two priorities between the domains give two outputs. The
strictly-before rule has no such parameter, and multi-domain evaluation
is deterministic with no order between simultaneously active domains
appearing in the semantics. It also makes cross-domain causality free. A
transport's operand is never instantaneous, so
$upright("Causal") thick Delta$ is unchanged and no cross-domain cycle
can be instantaneous. Every crossing costs one destination-visible step;
“synchronous sub-domains evaluated in one instant” are, in this model,
the same domain.

Every $upright("sync")$ carries an explicit initial value, used at a
destination activation with no earlier source activation. Totality
extends to the multi-domain case --- a causal, globally well formed
design with well-typed inputs has a value in every domain at every tick
--- so the first activation is deterministic with the stated initial
values. Semantic identity and dimension pass through transport
untouched, by the typing rule; a crossing from `Tilt@fast` to
`Tilt@slow` authorizes neither `Tilt -> MotorAngle` nor
`q Length -> q Time`.

== Occurrences across domains
<occurrences-across-domains>
Optional values remain the right per-activation representation of an
occurrence. What changes across domains is transport. A single-instant
read loses events: under $upright("sync")$, two fast occurrences and one
are indistinguishable at the slow tick, and a single occurrence followed
by a quiet fast tick is dropped. The counterexample is against
$upright("sync")$ as an #emph[event transport], not against optional
types.

The window model separates the two. What a destination should see is the
source's occurrences at the source activations since the destination's
own previous activation. On tick sets, this window equals the source's
accumulated log read at the current tick minus the log length read at
the previous destination activation --- two single-instant reads, a
$upright("sync")$ of a source-side accumulator and a $upright("delay")$
of a cursor. Policies are functions of the window. `latest`, `count`,
and `count` with `latest` each lose information and each identifies
distinct windows; only the list is injective. So multiplicity and order
are observable, buffering is required to keep them, buffering is a
structured use of the existing state basis plus list data, and a bound
on the buffer is a validation obligation.

Writing the buffer in the object language needs sequence data, and the
kernel now has it: an ordinary list type $upright("list") thick tau$,
data exactly when $tau$ is, with six registered operators (`nil`,
`cons`, `length`, `take`, `reverse`, `head`) typed like every other
primitive. No typing, evaluation, or domain rule was added, and every
earlier theorem held unchanged. With it the buffer is five declarations:
a source-side log `cons src (delay nil log)`, its transport
`sync src nil log`, the length `seen` of the transported log, a cursor
`delay 0 seen`, and the window `reverse (take (seen − cursor) logD)`.
The correspondence is proved for every schedule, input, destination and
tick: the window declaration evaluates, in the destination domain, to
exactly the source's values at the window's activations, in order and
with multiplicity. The list representation is injective on windows,
whereas `latest`, `count`, a fold, and any summary bounded to a fixed
number of newest entries each identify distinct windows --- so a
lossless summary is necessarily unbounded, and the list is the smallest
general sequence representation tested. Capacity remains validation: for
a finite horizon sufficiency is decidable and the least sufficient
capacity is computed with a proof; for periodic schedules one
destination period suffices at every horizon. Overflow is never
implicit. Dropping the oldest or newest entries is the identity under
sufficient capacity and changes the trace otherwise; the only policy
that preserves the kernel semantics is to reject the deployment. An
event type is still not needed: an event is a data-typed declaration in
a domain, and its lossless cross-domain view is the window.

= Physical Outputs Without Arbitration
<physical-outputs-without-arbitration>
== The model
<the-model>
A declaration computes a value; it does not move hardware. Physical
effect happens only through an explicit #strong[drive edge] from a
declaration to a #strong[physical sink]:

- $upright("OutputId")$ --- the nominal identity of a sink, a logical
  actuator channel;
- $Omega : upright("OutputId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("OutputSpec")$,
  a sink's accepted type and clock, declared by the deployment;
- $beta : upright("DeclId") arrow.r upright("Option") thick upright("OutputId")$
  --- the drive edges, a write-once per-declaration projection of the
  same shape as $upright(K)$\;
- $upright("DriveWF") thick Omega thick upright(K) thick Delta thick beta$
  --- each edge is well formed when the driver's expected type
  #emph[equals] the sink's accepted type and the driver's clock is the
  sink's clock;
- $upright("SingleDriver") thick beta$ --- at most one driver per sink:
  if $beta thick d_1$ and $beta thick d_2$ are both
  $upright("some") thick o$ then $d_1 = d_2$\;
- $upright("CompleteOutputs") thick beta thick italic(r e q)$ --- every
  required sink is driven.

Nothing was added to types, typing, the domain judgment, the evaluation
relation, or the grant. The binding neither coerces nor converts nor
synchronizes. A declaration typed `Tilt`, or bare `q Angle`, cannot
drive a `MotorAngle` sink. A sink that accepts a representation type
needs an explicit `rep`-typed declaration in front of it, so the
distinction between semantic target and hardware representation stays
visible. A slow driver reading a fast value must $upright("sync")$ it
upstream, since a fast driver cannot drive a slow sink and the edge
never synchronizes.

Sink identity is nominal for the same reason concept identity is. Keying
the binding by type collides when two servos accept the same type;
keying by concept conflates a concept with a device, since one concept
may feed several; keying by declaration makes two declarations that both
mean the steering motor into two sinks, and the multiple-driver
counterexample cannot even be stated. “Desired steering angle” is a
value; “the steering motor” is a resource; the kernel keeps them in
different sorts.

== One final driver
<one-final-driver>
The principle is #emph[many contributors, one explicit final driver].
Take two declarations driving one sink, each globally well typed, well
clocked, causal, and individually well formed. Only
$upright("SingleDriver")$ fails, and it fails globally rather than at
either edge. What has gone wrong is semantic: with two drivers the
physical output is not a function of the tick, and there is a tick at
which the sink receives two values. With one driver, the physical output
is a partial function of the tick, and with $upright("SingleDriver")$ it
is unique wherever it exists:

$  & upright("PhysicalOutput") thick S thick Delta thick I thick Omega thick beta thick o thick t thick v thick := thick exists d thin italic(s p e c) .\
 & quad beta thick d = upright("some") thick o thick and thick Omega thick o = upright("some") thick italic(s p e c)\
 & quad and thick upright("MEv") thick S thick Delta thick I thick italic(s p e c) . italic(c l o c k) thick t thick\[\]thick\(upright("declRef") thick d\)thick v . $

Contributors are dependencies, not drivers.
`base + corr -> final -> motor` passes every check; priority is an
ordinary conditional in the single driver; blend, maximum, and clamp are
ordinary declarations of the target type. Why arbitration must be
explicit is best shown rather than argued: first-wins, last-wins, and
maximum over the same value graph give three different physical outputs.
A hidden policy is a design decision made on the designer's behalf.

Binding an unbound declaration to an undriven sink is a refinement and
preserves $upright("SingleDriver")$. Binding to an already-driven sink
is invalid. Retargeting a sink's accepted type, renaming a sink, or
detaching an edge invalidates an unchanged design. Partial designs may
leave sinks undriven; executable designs may not.

== What was removed
<what-was-removed>
The earlier draft of BDL had an effect row on the behavior judgment,
action requests as values, and per-context policies that allowed,
suppressed, transformed, and arbitrated requests, resolved in a
dedicated phase of each tick. Each was tried in toy form against the
single-driver model, and the outcome is narrow. Direct effect rows ---
the set of sinks a declaration drives --- are exactly the drive edges,
and single-driver is exactly their pairwise disjointness. Propagated
rows, which also include the sinks of everything a declaration reads,
flag a valid design in which a display reads the driver. Action values
move the conflict into the collector that consumes them, which must then
be a policy, which is the single driver by another name. None of this
bears on richer effect systems; it says that these formulations add no
rejection the single-driver rule lacks. Per-context action policies no
longer exist as a mechanism, and the StateHandler cases that involved
them --- event-latched activation with exit-wins, state-local output
choice, nested choice with an output --- are ordinary declarations with
one driver and were run as such.

= Target-Specific Hardware Validation
<target-specific-hardware-validation>
Everything to this point is board-independent. A design that is typed,
causal, clock-consistent, and output-complete may still not fit the
microcontroller it is to run on, and that question is answered by a
validation layer that never touches the kernel.

== Resources, capabilities, requirements
<resources-capabilities-requirements>
A target is a finite table. A #strong[resource] --- a pin --- has an
identity, a list of #strong[capabilities] from a shared vocabulary
(digital in/out, PWM, analog in, interrupt, the I2C, SPI, and UART
lines), and, per capability, the #strong[unit] backing it, such as the
timer behind a PWM pin or the peripheral behind a bus line. A
#strong[hardware description] is a list of resources with a
per-capability sharing policy: bus lines are shareable, everything else
is exclusive.

A design's needs are #strong[requirements]. Each has an identity, one
capability, an optional fixed resource for a manual pin choice, and an
optional membership in a group with a unit relation, #emph[same] or
#emph[distinct]:

$ upright("Requirement") = chevron.l thick & italic(i d)\,thick italic(c a p)\,\
 & italic(f i x e d) : upright("Option") thick upright("ResourceId")\,\
 & italic(g r o u p) : upright("Option") thick\(bb(N) times upright("UnitRel")\)thick chevron.r . $

Requirements are generated from the physical sinks of the previous
section by a #strong[device kind]: an H-bridge channel needs a PWM line
and a digital output; an I2C sensor needs SDA and SCL on the same unit;
a quadrature encoder needs two interrupt lines. The pipeline is

$ upright("OutputId") arrow.r upright("DeviceKind") arrow.r upright("Requirements") arrow.r upright("solve") arrow.r upright("Assignment")\, $

and the sink never enumerates pins, so swapping the board is re-solving
the same requirements with the design untouched. Requirement identity is
independent of sink and declaration identity: one sink generates several
requirements, and two identical PWM needs must be two distinct
variables.

An #strong[assignment] is a list of requirement--resource pairs. It is
#strong[partially valid] when every entry is supported --- the resource
has the capability and any fixed choice is respected --- and every pair
is #strong[compatible]: two entries on the same resource must have the
same capability and it must be shareable, and two entries in the same
group must have equal units under #emph[same] and different units under
#emph[distinct]. It is #strong[valid for] a requirement list when
partially valid and covering exactly that list; the target is
#strong[satisfiable] when such an assignment exists.

== A sound and complete solver
<a-sound-and-complete-solver>
Every constraint is unary or binary, so validity is prefix-closed, and
an exhaustive depth-first search that prunes on unary support and
pairwise compatibility with the current prefix is complete as well as
sound. Both are proved: if the solver returns an assignment it is valid
for the requirements, and if a valid assignment exists the solver
returns one. Feasibility of a finite instance is therefore decidable,
and the solver runs inside the proof checker by `decide`. The instance
is small enough that a general constraint solver @dechter2003constraint
is unnecessary; the claim is about this scope, not about embedded
allocation in general.

Extension of a target --- adding capabilities, units, or sharing to
existing resources --- preserves every valid assignment. Removing a
resource, adding or strengthening a requirement, or fixing a pin may
not.

== Case study: an Arduino Nano
<case-study-an-arduino-nano>
The Arduino Nano's digital and analog pins are encoded as a table: PWM
on D3, D5, D6, D9, D10, and D11 backed by timers 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, and 2;
external interrupts on D2 and D3; I2C on A4 and A5. A design with four
H-bridge motor channels and one I2C inertial sensor is satisfiable, and
the solver's output is the assignment a tool would present:

```text
M1 -> D3 / D0     M2 -> D5 / D1
M3 -> D6 / D2     M4 -> D9 / D4
IMU -> A4 / A5
```

Two counterexamples fix the boundary between kernel and validation.
Seven independent PWM actuators pass every kernel condition --- globally
well formed, well clocked, causal, every drive edge well formed,
single-driver, output-complete --- and are unsatisfiable on the Nano,
which has six PWM pins. The same requirements are satisfiable on a
larger mock board with six more PWM pins on three more timers. Two
interrupt lines and six PWM lines meet every capability #emph[count]
exactly, two and six, and are unsatisfiable, because D3 is both the only
second interrupt pin and one of the six PWM pins. Capability counting is
not feasibility. Further examples establish that two PWM requirements
pinned to the same pin are rejected, that two I2C sensors on A4/A5 are
accepted since allocation is not all-different, that a manual pin choice
can turn a satisfiable design unsatisfiable while a consistent one is
honoured, that four PWM lines required on independent timers are
unsatisfiable on the Nano's three timers though six PWM pins exist, and
that TX and RX pinned to one UART unit stay together.

The explanation facility reports the first dead end under greedy
placement. For the seven-actuator design it names the seventh actuator
and, for each PWM pin, the actuator blocking it. This is #emph[a]
conflict under one placement order, not a minimal unsatisfiable core,
and it is meaningful only when the solver has already returned no
assignment.

== Two kinds of evidence
<two-kinds-of-evidence>
Hardware feasibility is evidence about the pair (design, target), and it
is not monotone in the sense the preservation theorems require. Six
actuators are satisfiable; adding a seventh --- a monotone extension of
the design by a declaration and its sink --- is not. The distinction
drawn earlier between evidence that survives refinement and evidence
that is rechecked after every change is here concrete. Commitments
discharged compositionally survive $upright("EnvRefines")$\;
deployability on a target is re-solved; and the two are never merged.
This is why the workspace reports them as different states.

What the layer does not model should be stated as plainly. Voltage,
current, thermal budgets, memory, processor load, deadlines, bus
bandwidth, torque, travel, and PWM frequency values are outside it. Some
of these need summation constraints that are not binary, and while the
architecture leaves room for a compatibility predicate over sets,
nothing here establishes it. Units are one integer per capability per
resource, which models which timer or which UART but not timer modes.

= Elaboration and Tool Architecture
<elaboration-and-tool-architecture>
The surface editor and kernel are connected by an elaboration function
from surface designs to kernel environments with diagnostics. No
elaborator has been implemented; this section states the passes that the
kernel's structure implies, and what each is responsible for.

#strong[Name and signature resolution.] Resolve semantic properties to
identities, Mapping signatures to declaration interfaces, contexts,
device kinds, units, and imported components. At this stage an
unresolved `Tilt -> Brightness` mapping already has a stable identity
and an expected type, and every reference to it is typed.

#strong[Formula elaboration.] For each Mapping with a definition, check
the definition against the declared codomain under the grant of the
declaration's own signature. A scalar formula attached to a `Brightness`
output elaborates to $upright("mk")_(upright("Brightness"))\(dots.h\)$
because the surrounding signature announces the concept; the constructor
is inserted by the elaborator and is legal only there. Units elaborate
to scaled dimensioned literals. Curve, example, and component
definitions elaborate to the same realization form.

#strong[Temporal lowering.] Surface temporal phrases lower to the
declaration shapes of the derived-operator table. A context lowers to an
activation declaration, an entry declaration, gated and reset local
state, and a conditional in each output's driver. A reusable stateful
component is instantiated into fresh declarations at each use, because
temporal state cannot occur under a binder.

#strong[Domain assignment.] Domains are declared, so this pass records
the clock environment and checks the domain judgment. A reference across
domains without a transport is reported at the reference, in the
designer's names for the two domains, with the two legitimate
resolutions --- transport the value with a stated initial value, or move
the reader to the source's domain --- stated in terms of their
behavioral consequence.

#strong[Output binding.] Record the drive edges and check type and clock
equality, single-driver, and, for executable designs, completeness.
Where several contexts would drive one output, the elaborator emits one
driver whose body selects among them; the selection is visible in the
elaborated design.

#strong[Hardware validation.] Generate requirements from device kinds,
run the solver against the selected target, and attach the assignment or
the explanation to the bindings.

#strong[Normalization and erasure.] After checking is complete, semantic
identities, dimensions, and domains carry no computational content and
may be erased; erasure is proved sound for identities and for
dimensions. Nominal wrappers introduced by elaboration cancel,
$upright("rep")\(upright("mk")_s thick e\)arrow.r.squiggly e$, and the
flattened program is checked under the universal grant because every
construction was authorized at its declaration. Unfolding all
realizations into a closed term preserves typing on the delay-free
fragment and agrees with tick-by-tick evaluation on first-order designs;
the higher-order case holds up to closure equivalence and was not
formalized. Erasure is applied selectively at boundaries the checker
cannot see through --- supplied blocks, device bindings, the public
interface of generated code --- where wrappers are retained so that the
host compiler continues to check what BDL cannot.

The kernel never depends on normalization to decide type equality; it is
not dependently typed, and normalization is an analysis and
code-generation instrument. Floating-point arithmetic is not
associative, so any symbolic normalization over the reals must record
the resulting numerical deviation as an obligation rather than silently
altering the property being checked.

= Mechanized Design-Space Evaluation
<mechanized-design-space-evaluation>
The kernel of this paper was obtained by a method, and the method is
part of the contribution. Each phase of the development took a family of
candidate constructs from the earlier draft, formalized the smallest
plausible version and its alternatives in Lean 4 without external
libraries, and attacked each with the same questions. What does it
reject that the others accept? What does it accept that it should not?
Is it a special case of another? Which operations on a design are
refinements under it, and which are edits? Constructs were promoted from
the experiment modules to the kernel only after surviving, and the
theorems about them were re-proved in the promoted form.

== Claim strength
<claim-strength>
Formal counterexamples reject the specific tested design, not every
conceivable design in the same informal family. Every conclusion in the
development is therefore labelled with one of a fixed set of strengths,
and this paper has used the same vocabulary throughout: #strong[formally
proved] (a theorem in the development); #strong[formally rejected by
counterexample] (a mechanized example breaks the specific formulation);
#strong[reduction by proof] (a theorem shows one design is a special
case or erasure of another); #strong[tested formulation redundant] (the
one formulation examined duplicates an existing mechanism; the family is
not excluded); #strong[engineering preference] (argued, not proved); and
#strong[not ruled out]. Nothing in the development is a proven
impossibility, and “minimal” in this paper always means minimal among
the tested designs.

== Scale and trust base
<scale-and-trust-base>
The development builds with Lean 4.33.1 with no `sorry`. The axioms used
are propositional extensionality and quotient soundness, the latter only
through function extensionality, and no classical choice. The kernel and
validation layer occupy eleven modules, with eight experiment modules
holding the alternatives and counterexamples; every trace, assignment,
and unsatisfiability result reported here was obtained by running a
proved-sound interpreter or solver inside the proof checker. Several
theorems are recorded as trivial by definition --- the typing half of
client stability is a one-liner, and the well-formedness of a refinement
target is unused because the invariant was moved into the definition ---
and they are reported as such rather than presented as content.

= Evaluation Plan
<evaluation-plan>
No user study has been run, and no elaborator, editor, or firmware
generator exists. This section states what should be measured and how,
without reporting results.

== Expected cognitive advantages
<expected-cognitive-advantages>
#strong[Lower viscosity.] Changing a transfer function edits one Mapping
definition rather than a procedural chain of read/compute/store/write
nodes.

#strong[Reduced hidden dependencies.] Semantic signatures expose what a
relationship consumes and produces, while the kernel rejects
incompatible connections before device code exists.

#strong[Reduced premature commitment.] An unresolved declaration allows
a designer to commit to a relationship without committing to its
implementation, sensor, or exact parameters.

This last item requires a qualification that the rest do not.
Signature-first authoring is not claimed to be the spontaneous habit of
every designer. One of the authors, working on a hardware project,
adopted it when the complexity of a subsystem exceeded what could be
held in view at once, and did not adopt it on simpler tasks, where a
signature and its definition were written in a single motion. The
hypothesis is therefore narrower than a claim about how designers think.
It is that conventional tools provide no legal position for an undefined
relationship, so the strategy cannot be adopted even when it would help,
and that BDL supplies that position at no cost. Whether inexperienced
designers take up the strategy once it is available, and whether doing
so improves their designs, is an empirical question and is included in
the study below.

#strong[Better role expressiveness.] Contexts, Mappings, and temporal
modifiers correspond to product-design concepts rather than generic
program-control constructs.

#strong[Improved error locality.] A mismatch is attached to a product
relationship or binding rather than surfacing later as an embedded
runtime fault, and a hardware infeasibility is attached to the binding
that causes it.

== Comparative study
<comparative-study>
A first controlled study should compare BDL against at least two
baselines: a statechart-based prototyping environment and a node-based
or Arduino-style implementation workflow. Participants should be
industrial-design students and practitioners with limited professional
software-engineering experience.

Tasks should include specifying a sensor-to-actuator mapping; adding
temporal qualification such as “for 300 ms”; adding an orthogonal safety
override that competes with an interaction context for one output;
replacing a sensor with a different sample rate; relating a slowly
updated quantity to a fast interaction, which forces a cross-domain
decision; choosing a board that cannot accommodate the design; and
modifying a mapping late in the task.

Primary outcomes should not be limited to task time or a usability
scale. More important measures are semantic errors in the final
behavior; the number of implementation-only concepts participants must
manipulate; time to detect an impossible or conflicting behavior;
fidelity between verbal design intent and the elaborated model; the
number and diversity of behavior alternatives explored; the quality of
handoff to an engineer who did not observe the authoring session;
subjective confidence calibrated against actual correctness; and
whether, and at what level of task complexity, participants declare a
relationship before defining it when the tool permits both.

The last measure tests the hypothesis stated above rather than assuming
it. Because signature-first authoring may be a strategy that appears
only above a complexity threshold, the tasks should vary in scale, and
the default state of a newly created Mapping Block is itself a
manipulable factor: a block that opens onto an empty formula editor and
one that opens onto a signature with an explicitly legal undefined body
invite different first actions. A small comparison of these two defaults
is considerably cheaper than the full study.

The interaction model of this paper adds hypotheses of its own. Whether
the single-driver diagnostic leads participants to an explicit
combination block they can later read, whether the cross-domain question
is answered correctly for a safety condition, and whether participants
distinguish a valid design from a deployable one when the workspace
reports them separately, are each measurable in the tasks above.

== Field study
<field-study>
A controlled study cannot establish whether the representation fits real
design practice. A second phase should embed the tool in a semester-long
product-design studio or an industry project. The study should observe
where unresolved declarations persist, which semantic types designers
invent, where they request escape hatches, how often the single-driver
condition is met by a combination rule the designer finds natural, and
how often engineers reinterpret or replace BDL artifacts during
implementation. This field evidence is necessary before claiming that
the language is native to industrial design rather than merely pleasant
to its authors.

= Related Work
<related-work>
== Physical prototyping and design tools
<physical-prototyping-and-design-tools>
Phidgets reduced the implementation cost of physical interaction by
presenting hardware components through a uniform software abstraction
@greenberg2001phidgets. d.tools integrated physical prototyping,
statechart-based behavior, testing, and analysis for designers
@hartmann2006dtools. Exemplar addressed the same authoring cost from the
opposite direction, letting designers demonstrate sensor behavior and
having the system infer the recognizer @hartmann2007exemplar\; in BDL
that technique is one of several ways to supply a definition, attached
to a signature that already fixes the relationship's semantic boundary.
The difference from these systems is not that they could not represent
behavior. It is that their dominant representation still asks designers
to formulate substantial portions of behavior in an operational
structure; BDL investigates whether the typed semantic relationship can
be the primary artifact, with operational machinery elaborated
underneath.

== Dataflow and model-based engineering tools
<dataflow-and-model-based-engineering-tools>
LabVIEW established the graphical dataflow instrument-control paradigm;
Simulink with Stateflow combines dataflow blocks with hierarchical state
machines; Modelica models physical systems through acausal equations
with units and dimensions
@national2024labview@mathworks2024simulink@modelica2023spec. These
systems are considerably more capable than what is proposed here. The
distinction is in the primary artifact and the intended author. In each
of them the artifact is an executable model whose blocks denote
computation and the author holds an engineering model; BDL's artifact is
a set of typed relationships that need not yet compute anything, and the
author holds a product model. SysML and model-based systems engineering
address precise system structure, requirements, and verification at a
broader level @omg2025sysml\; BDL is intended as a front end for early
design that could later export into such representations, not as a
replacement.

== Synchronous languages and functional reactive programming
<synchronous-languages-and-functional-reactive-programming>
The kernel's temporal basis is that of the synchronous dataflow
tradition. Lustre's `pre` with an initial value, in a
declaration-per-stream setting, is the delay primitive here
@halbwachs1991lustre\; the rule that a value computed at an instant is
visible at the next instant, applied across domains, is the
strictly-before rule; and causality as a static property follows the
same line @colaco2005state. Esterel established the synchronous
hypothesis under which these semantics are deterministic
@berry1992esterel. Where these languages recover clocks by a clock
calculus @colaco2003clocks, BDL requires domain identity to be declared,
for the reason given in the clock-domain section. Zélus extends the
lineage to hybrid systems @bourke2013zelus, which is the direction in
which the continuous-dynamics limitation noted below would have to be
addressed.

Functional reactive programming established behaviors and events as
compositional abstractions for time-varying computation
@elliott1997fran, and FrTime gave a dynamic dataflow embedding with
formal semantics @cooper2006frtime. BDL's reactive core is much more
restricted, and the restriction is a result rather than a starting
point: under a tick semantics with one domain, a signal type rejects
nothing and an event type is an optional-valued stream, so neither
appears in the kernel.

== Typed holes and structure editing
<typed-holes-and-structure-editing>
Hazelnut demonstrated that incomplete structured terms can remain
statically meaningful under bidirectional typing @omar2017hazelnut, and
Hazel extended this to live evaluation around holes @omar2019live. BDL
takes the idea that incompleteness is a first-class static state and
relocates it. The kernel object is a named declaration whose realization
is optional; holes are positional in the Hazelnut tradition and named
here; and the stability result concerns clients of a declaration under
refinement rather than the typing of the incomplete term itself. This
relocation reduces to ordinary interface/implementation separation and
is not a new hole calculus.

== Dimensional typing
<dimensional-typing>
Dimensional typing follows the units-of-measure line begun by Kennedy
@kennedy1997units. The contribution here is only the placement --- the
algebra in primitive operator types with no dimension-specific rule, and
the separation of dimension from nominal identity --- together with the
observation, mechanized, that the numeric baseline is the erasure.

== Effects
<effects>
An earlier draft of BDL borrowed the separation between operation and
interpretation from algebraic effects @plotkin2013handlers and
anticipated scoped effects for context-sensitive interpretation
@yang2022scoped. The kernel presented here has no effect system. The
negative result is stated narrowly in the section on physical outputs
and does not bear on effect systems in general; it bears on the
formulations tried for this design problem, where a single explicit
driver per output expressed everything the request-and-policy model
expressed and made visible what it hid.

== Resource allocation
<resource-allocation>
The hardware validation layer is a finite constraint satisfaction
problem with unary and binary constraints @dechter2003constraint, and
its solver is a plain backtracking search whose soundness and
completeness are proved. No claim is made relative to the embedded
co-design literature; the layer's contribution is architectural --- the
design is never an input to the solver, and feasibility is kept as a
separate, non-monotone kind of evidence --- rather than algorithmic.

= Discussion and Limitations
<discussion-and-limitations>
== Why the signature is a design object
<why-the-signature-is-a-design-object>
The most consequential decision in BDL is treating a declared
relationship as visible product intent. In programming, a signature is
often documentation and a static contract around code. In BDL it can
precede any code-like definition and remain useful on its own:
$? f : upright("Tilt") arrow.r upright("Brightness")$ says that the
designer has committed to a causal design relationship and to its
semantic boundary, and does not say how the mapping is computed. Clients
are typed against the type view and depend on the interface only through
it and through monotone evidence, so the partial commitment is not a
weaker form of a complete one. It is the form on which everything
downstream already rests.

== Nominal identity in three places
<nominal-identity-in-three-places>
BDL makes the same choice three times. On the axis of quantity, `sem`
makes semantic identity nominal: two concepts of equal representation
are distinct, and moving between them is a declared relationship. On the
axis of time, `ClockId` makes temporal identity nominal: two domains of
equal rate are distinct, and moving between them is a `sync` with an
initial value. On the axis of effect, `OutputId` makes sink identity
nominal: two sinks of equal accepted type are distinct, and driving one
is an explicit edge. In each case the identity is independent of
representation, of rate, and of type respectively; in each case the
crossing is a visible artifact rather than a compiler action; and in
each case the alternative --- identity by representation, by rate, or by
type --- collided or was ambiguous for a mechanized reason. The three
are not all placed alike. Semantic identity is in the type, while clock
and sink identity are projections beside the interface checked by
separate global judgments, because putting the clock in the type forces
polymorphism on every pure mapping. Symmetry was not a design goal; it
is what remained.

== Formal limits
<formal-limits>
The calculus assumes discrete logical clocks, deterministic primitives,
and finite temporal state. It does not define continuous dynamics,
probabilistic sensor estimates, distributed clock uncertainty, or hybrid
semantics. These are substantial extensions, not footnotes.

Several boundaries are internal to what was formalized. Causality is
conservative for lambda-guarded cycles. The buffer correspondence
assumes an input source. The equation language is total first-order-data
computation with higher-order functions and one list recursor; sum types
are encoded as a tag with an optional payload rather than added, and the
library's evaluation lemmas assume the predicate argument implements a
Boolean function. The agreement between unfolding and tick-by-tick
evaluation is proved for first-order designs only. The StateHandler
reduction covers the tested cases and not contexts with their own
clocks. Hardware validation covers discrete pin and peripheral
allocation with unary and binary constraints, and no numeric electrical
or timing property. The explanation facility reports a first dead end,
not a minimal core. Interface-level references --- commitments that
mention other declarations --- are not modelled, so the dependency graph
is over realizations only. Whether a realization may delegate its grant
to a higher-order argument is untested. Affine units are modelled as
coordinate changes; a point/difference sort for restricting
absolute-temperature arithmetic is optional validation and is not
implemented.

== Risks of the design
<risks-of-the-design>
#strong[Semantic-type proliferation.] If every semantic distinction
creates a visible type, the editor may become bureaucratic. The system
needs reusable type libraries and sensible defaults, and the study
should record which types designers invent.

#strong[Formula anxiety.] Not every designer wants to write equations.
Formula authoring must coexist with curves, examples, and direct
manipulation.

#strong[Hidden elaboration.] A context that elaborates to an activation
declaration, an entry declaration, gated state, and a conditional driver
is, in the elaborated design, several objects the designer did not draw.
Hiding this can make runtime behavior mysterious. The explanation view
of the interaction model is the proposed answer; whether designers use
it, and whether it explains what they came to ask, is untested.

#strong[False confidence.] A formally typed diagram can look verified
even when no physical property has been checked, and a typed, causal,
clock-consistent, output-complete design can be unplaceable on the
chosen board. The workspace states of the interaction model exist to
keep these apart, and the risk is sharpest for obligations discharged by
declaration rather than by analysis.

#strong[Complexity migration into tooling.] Much of what was removed
from the kernel --- event policies, output selection, context semantics
--- reappears as elaboration. The kernel is smaller and better
understood; the elaborator is larger and does not yet exist. The claim
that the surface is “only syntax” over the kernel is a claim about
tested cases, and the untested cases are the ones most likely to demand
a kernel extension.

#strong[Usability hypotheses unestablished.] Every statement in this
paper about what designers find natural is a hypothesis, including every
sentence of the interaction model. The one anecdote reported is a single
author's practice on a single project.

= Conclusion
<conclusion>
Modern industrial products increasingly combine physical form with
sensing, computation, and control, yet designers still lack a behavior
medium with the immediacy that CAD provides for geometry. BDL proposes
that the missing medium should not be a friendlier version of procedural
programming. It should be a language in which typed product
relationships are first-class design artifacts, and in which an
unresolved relationship is a legal state of the design rather than a
defect in a program.

What that looks like in use is a workspace in which a designer names
what the product is about, draws the relationships between those things,
and leaves each undefined until there is something to say; refines them
locally, by formula or curve or example, without the diagram changing
shape; states time as a qualifier rather than as a timer; gives
situations a name and a boundary rather than a transition table; is
asked for one final target where two behaviors reach for one output, and
for one stated way of seeing across a boundary where two quantities move
at different speeds; and chooses a board last, receiving either a pin
allocation or a conflict, with the design itself untouched either way.

The kernel that supports this is small, and it is small for reasons that
were checked. A declaration has a frozen type, growable public
commitments, and a write-once body; clients are typed against the type
view, and refinement preserves what they established while edits reopen
it. Semantic concepts are nominal, represented through a write-once
binding, and constructed only where a signature announces them;
dimensions are carried by the types of primitive operators. One temporal
primitive reads a clock domain at its previous activation, and
single-domain delay is its diagonal; evaluation is deterministic and
total exactly on causal designs; every designer-facing temporal operator
is a shape over it. Clock domains are nominal and checked by a judgment
rather than a type; crossings are explicit, initialized, and strictly
earlier. Physical outputs are nominal sinks with one driver each, and
every combination of behaviors is ordinary computation upstream of the
drive edge. A separate validation layer decides whether the design fits
a board, and its evidence is kept apart from the evidence that survives
refinement.

Each of these is minimal among the designs that were tested, and the
paper has tried to say, for each, what was proved, what was rejected by
counterexample, and what was preferred. What has not been built --- the
elaborator, the editor, the firmware path, and the studies --- is where
the claims about designers would be tested. The research question is not
whether designers can be taught a simpler programming language. It is
whether product behavior can become a #emph[design material] whose
structure is intuitive at the surface and rigorous underneath, and the
kernel presented here is the part of that question that can now be
stated precisely.
